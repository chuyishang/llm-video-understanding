"1. Choose a quality ground beef, ideally a 80/20 mix. Season well with salt, pepper and other preferred seasonings such as onion powder or garlic.\n2. Form the beef into equal-sized patties, ensure to form indentations in the middle for even cooking.\n3. Preheat grill or pan to medium-high heat. \n4. Put seasoned patties on grill/pan, and cook for about 3-4 minutes each side or until desired level of doneness is met. Flip patties only once during the process.\n5. During cooking, prepare your buns by toasting them on the grill or in a pan for added flavor. You may optionally spread a thin layer of oil or butter on the buns before toasting.\n6. As the burgers are nearly done cooking, add cheese onto patties and cover grill/pan to allow cheese to melt if desired.\n7. Remove patties from heat and let them rest for a few minutes.\n8. Assemble burgers by placing patties on toasted buns, and adding preferred toppings such as lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, sauces, etc.\n9. Serve burgers immediately while hot, and enjoy!"
