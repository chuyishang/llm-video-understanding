{"tlwWhwJyBms": " 00:00 here's a really simple way to make a good cup of coffee into a saucepan I'm just gonna add a scoop of coffee per cup of coffee the way you like it the way you normally would make it I'm gonna turn that burner to low and in the meantime I'm gonna boil some water in my kettle you can just boil the water in the saucepan and then add the coffee later it's just that my kettle boils water much faster once that comes to the boil I'm just gonna use my mug to measure the amount of water I need and I'm gonna add that to my saucepan and now I'm simply just going to stir this until there's no more foam on top and until most of the coffee grounds have sunk to the bottom it only takes a couple of minutes and you can turn your heat off I've already added cream and  00:01 sugar to my cup I'm also gonna add a strainer if you use really finely ground coffee sometimes you can get away without a strainer so I've steep my coffee for about three minutes but you can go up to ten fifteen minutes if you like having the burner on low helps keep it warm but it may evaporate a little bit and it's as simple as that just strain it into your cup this is a really great way to make coffee if you don't have a coffee maker or paper filters or anything like this this is a good way to make campfire coffee it's really simple and it results in a really great cup of coffee so yeah this is a very rustic way to make coffee but what makes a rich cup of coffee are the oils from the coffee and paper filters will filter that up so I like making it this way it's not fully strained so I can get a good rich coffee flavor ", "TvNWLrRzIAM": " 00:00 hi there I'm going to show you one of the most delicious ways to make coffee Turkish coffee Turkish coffee goes by several names which vary from region to region everyone has their own style of making it and each style produces different results remember the most authentic and correct way to brew coffee is the way that you like it best here's what you'll need a metal pot also known as an e-brake preferably made from copper but other metals are fine some grounded coffee and if you like some sugar sugar is optional it's important to use medium roasted and finely grounded coffee this is absolutely essential you can buy this from most supermarkets and delicatessens the coffee needs to be ultra fine like powder or you can just grind the coffee beans yourself if you do grind them make sure it's powdered like flour otherwise  00:01 the texture the coffee won't be right I'm making coffee for three people so I'm filling the pot with three of these cups of water these are Turkish coffee cups which are like expresso cups but with vertical sides the water I'm using is room-temperature and adding three teaspoons of sugar one for each person let the sugar sink to the bottom without stirring as it heats the sugar will caramelize and disperse through the water which will give it a very palatable taste add one heaped teaspoon of coffee for each person you can vary this according to your preference if you  00:02 like your coffee strong add a little extra place the pot on the stove with low heat don't stir just yet let it heat up for a minute or two and then stir slowly you after a few minutes the coffee will come to the boil notice the ring of foam forming at the top remove the pot from the heat before it overflows spoon a little of the foam or crema into each cup before returning a pot to the stove for most aficionados of Turkish coffee this is a benchmark of quality the more foam the better coffee when the coffee Frost's up a second time remove the pot  00:03 and pour the coffee with the remaining froth into the cups do this nice and slowly so that you preserve the texture of the crema the phone already in the cups Turkish coffee is best served with a glass of water to clean a pallet before taking your first sip this will allow you to really enjoy the rich flavor of the coffee if you found this helpful
