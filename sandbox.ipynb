       " 'transcript': \"[music] [music] Hello, I'm Chris, with the mobile Internet Resource Center here to give you kind of an important warning Slash safety tips. Last thing to look out for. And that is how long has it been since you've checked on the help of your hot spot batteries? Now a local hot spot like this, Netgear Ac 791, rely on having a battery inside them to work. and even if you have them plugged in and are tethering them full-time to a computer or to a mobile router, they generally don't work at all, or very well without a battery installed. So you have to keep this battery in and people are concerned about. well, what happens to this battery If it's plugged in continuously and always charging for the most part, it's not a big deal, but there are some things you got to be aware of. the old Pantech Mhs 291 L. hot spot was notorious for having a poor charging circuit and it would destroy batteries over and over and over again that were left into charge, and be kind, kind of a major black spot against that particular hot spot and people were always needing to buyspares or figure out ways to modify the hot spots Run without the batteries. Most other hot spots have gone a lot longer without major reports of problems, but some like this, Uh, Netgear Ac 791 l are now kind of reaching that point in their life that more and more people are noticing problems with the batteries, And this is what you have to look out for. Are is actually just reached the failure point, so every so often check on the health of your batteries. you physically examine them. If you see any sort of splits or swelling like this, one is kind of cracked open here. this battery is not safe to use anymore and should be properly discarded, electronic waste, recycling and replaced. And so it's good idea to have a spare battery on hand the neck, Your Ac 790, One else we're hearing more and more reports, the batteries. Their end of life is starting to split open like this. Keep an eye on other hotspots. It depends on the quality of their charging circuits of how well they're going to do of keeping a battery selfie over time. But batteries are consumable items. They do eventually wear out things you can do to help extend the battery life is when you're charging them, Try to keep the hotspots from overheating, Keep them cool. Keep the batteries cool. This means don't leave your hotspots sitting in a hot windshield. Don't have it pressed right up against a hot booster or hot electronics, and your tech cabinet, and maybe even add a little bit of an air gap. if you do just a little bit of space for some ventilation around how you have your hotspot set up doing this. You can be very successful going for four months and even a year on end of keeping it plugged in and running 24/7 But do check on it every so often, making sure that the battery is staying healthy. You know, some people wonder like well, what's the big deal if the battery starts to swell like this or cracks or splits open, bad things can happen if a battery fails. Usually the safety electronic circuits inside a device will prevent anything, But you do not want a battery to split apart and maybe catch fire or well, or the most basic is it could just fail and shut down your device. Suddenly you will notice. actually, when the batteries are close to their failure point, If you touch them, they can be very hot, almost scalding hot. And that is another sign that a battery is reaching its end of life and needs to be discarded as if it is getting extremely hot just on its own when charging. Check through the description and links attached to this video. We've got a links to get replacement of batteries for all the various brands of mobile hotspots. You might want to keep a spare on hand if you rely on connectivity, because most hotspots will not work if without a battery, and if the battery fails, you might be disconnected and not even able to get on Amazon to order a spare, so keep a spare on hand. if you rely on this and check the links for every resource available, [Music] [Music]\\n\",\n",
