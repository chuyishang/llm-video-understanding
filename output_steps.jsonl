Shannon Bennett at the California Academy of Sciences where I'm\nchief of science and dean of science and research collections I'm also an\nassociate curator of microbiology with a specialty in viruses and an expert on\nstudying how infectious diseases jumped from animals to humans\npart one virus basics what is a virus so embarrass is a very small particle of\ngenetic material packaged in a capsule that's a protein-based capsule the\n\n00:01\nenveloped viruses which stars coronavirus to is one of there's a\nmembrane around that capsule that's made up of fatty elements and then sticking\noutside of that envelope of fatty elements are proteins and these proteins\nare critical for how the virus gets into the host so the one thing about a virus\nis that it cannot copy itself without being inside of a host cell how does the\nvirus come into contact with a host cell the hotel is covered with receptors\nwhich are almost like a lock and the virus protein is like a key and that\nbond between the key of the virus and the lock of the host cell is very\nspecific and highly evolved in some cases to make sure that the virus gets\ninto only certain kinds of host cells with this corona virus the key is called\n\n00:02\nthe Spike protein and it binds to the host cell receptor the lock specifically\nthe bind is to host respiratory cells and the receptor is called a stew so\nonce the virus makes that lock and key relationship with the host cell it can\nenter into the host cell and do its thing\nhow does the virus spread viruses spread\nbetween hosts in ways that are basically determined by the kinds of cells that\nthey infect when they infect a host so for example viruses that infect\nrespiratory cells like stars coronavirus - are spread through the product of our\nrespiration system so coughing and sneezing and the droplets that we've\nproduced from deep in our lungs or even in our upper respiratory tract are key\nelements for how this virus spreads between people part two properties of\n\n00:03\nKovan 19 how does Kovan 19 the body when the\nhuman body is first infected we develop an innate immune response one of the\nprimary defense mechanisms that our body\nelicits is fever 88% of infectious cases that develop symptoms have fever they\nalso developed dry cough fatigue and ultimately can progress to these severe\nviral pneumonia type symptoms according to the CDC symptoms may also\ninclude chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat\nand loss of taste or smell what is the reproductive number of a virus the\nreproductive number of a pathogen is how we measure how infectious it is it can\n\n00:04\nbe seen as how many new infections does a single infected person give rise to so\nif the reproductive number is one that means every infected individual can\npotentially infect one other person if the reproductive number is less than one\neventually the disease will die out if the reproductive number is greater than\none the disease grows exponentially so in the case of SARS coronavirus to the\nreproductive number is being estimated on average at about two point five and\nthat means that every single individual that's infected can potentially infect\ntwo and a half on average new people so this is a very contagious virus and it's\ngrowing exponentially what is an incubation period of a virus the\nincubation period of a virus is the time between when a person is exposed and\n\n00:05\ninfected to when they develop symptoms and the challenge with this corona virus\nis that period is highly variable it seems to span anywhere from 1 to 14 days\nin some cases the incubation period is the time prior to symptoms when the\nviruses are not being efficiently spread from person to person that is not the\ncase with coded 19 people that are still\nincubating the virus prior to developing symptoms can infect other people what\ndoes it mean to be asymptomatic what's very tricky about this virus is\nthat many people don't develop symptoms or if they do they're very mild and they\neven go unnoticed so we call those infections asymptomatic SARS coronavirus\ntoo has a high reproductive number and a long incubation period even if you do\nnot feel sick you may still be able to transmit the virus to other people\n\n00:06\nduring the incubation period or as an asymptomatic carrier of the virus part 3\nreview a virus is an infectious agent made up of genetic material packaged in\na protein capsule viruses can only multiply if they successfully infect\nhost cells the protein of a virus is like a key and the host cell is like a\nlump every virus attaches to specific hosts based on the unique formation of\nthe lock and the key kovat 19 is a virus\nthat attaches efficiently to respiratory cells entering the body primarily\nthrough respiratory tissue such as through our nose or mouth to stay\nhealthy and prevent the spread of the virus\nyou should practice social distancing wash your hands thoroughly and\nfrequently and disinfect surfaces [Music]\n"}

sleep medicine and today we're going to\nbe talking about sleep apnea apnea in latin means a cessation of\nbreathing and sleep apnea is when people have pauses or cessation of breathing\nduring the night in their sleep the most common things we hear in people with\nsleep apnea is their partner will say that\nthey were snoring very loudly at night but not everybody that snores has sleep\napnea and not everybody that has sleep apnea snores\nmore commonly people will say they wake up a lot of times during the night\nto roll over or change sides on the bed but people will also often say that they\nwake up often to use the bathroom during the night\nand some people will think that they have prostate issues or they drank too\nmuch water but the reality is that their sleep is\nnot deep broken unrefreshing sleep results in significant daytime fatigue\nand in some cases sleepiness some of us will compensate by drinking\nlarge amounts of caffeine to not have those symptoms\n\n00:01\nother symptoms of sleep apnea include elevated blood pressure\nincreased anxiety for some people increased impulsivity which can also result in\nsymptoms that might look like adhd people that don't have\nregular solid sleep will often report significant problems with memory during\nthe day trouble with attention and focus and also trouble remembering things in\ngeneral beyond the mental effects of sleep apnea broken up sleep also results in\nsignificant biological effects a lot of times people will experience\nweight gain and increase carbohydrate craving because that's what the body\ndoes when it's tired during the day usually the first person to notice it is\nyour bed partner bed partners will often notice that someone is\nhaving episodes of not breathing during the night or loud snoring during the\nnight beyond your bed partner at home we'll\noften encourage our patients to use apps\nwhich may be able to record audio during the night\npeople will often listen to recordings of themselves at night and be able to\ntell if they have pauses and breathing or loud very labored breathing being\n\n00:02\naware that you wake up numerous times during the night can often be suggestive\nof sleep apnea once somebody does suspect they have sleep apnea the best\ninitial step is to get in touch with either your primary care physician or\na sleep specialist once a referral has been made for a sleep study there's two\ntypes of sleep studies that can be made there's one that's at home and there's\none that you can do in the lab they're both called polysomnography\nthe home sleep test is usually the easiest and most unobtrusive\npeople take home a device that looks about the size of a smartphone\nand the device during the night will monitor airflow through their nose\nhow their pulse oximetry blood oxygen levels are during the night\nand it'll also track how their chest is moving during the night the test is\npretty painless and straightforward and you'll often bring it back to the sleep\nlab or your sleep doctor and have that recording analyzed and\ndetermined if you have sleep apnea in lab testing is a little bit more\nadvanced and it involves sleeping over or spending the night in a sleep\nlab the main difference between a home sleep test and an\nin lab's sleep study is that during the in lab sleep study they'll also track\n\n00:03\nbrain wave activity in addition to leg movements and muscle tone in other parts\nof the body oftentimes these studies are a bit more\ncomprehensive but they're also more onerous and that not many people like\nsleeping in a lab sleep apnea is really a problem of air\nflow so it's important to recognize all the different parts of the airflow where\nit could get interrupted the most common form of treatment for\nsleep apnea is cpap cpap stands for continuous positive airway pressure\nand it's important to note that cpap machines don't really deliver oxygen\nthey're actually delivering room air they're very quiet and minimalist these\ndays and the masks have actually gotten quite small themselves\nthis is one example of a nasal pillow mask which actually fits over the head\nlike this and will actually enable you to breathe during the night using a cpap\na lot of people choose to use this kind of mask but there's other kind of masks\nas well in the end people will often report\nsleeping better through the night having better energy during the day and fewer\nawakenings while they sleep people with sleep apnea sometimes will\nhave really congested noses and they'll be mouth breathing during the day\nso having allergies corrected and having a being able to breathe well\n\n00:04\nthrough your nose during the night can be the beginning of treating sleep apnea\nthe tongue and throat are other areas that can often be involved in sleep apnea\nsome people have a really small jaw and they'll often say that they've had teeth\nextracted as children or their teeth will be really crowded\nand they'll have had braces at some point in their lives\nhaving a small jaw results in the tongue sitting further back in the throat\nand that in turn can also obstruct the airway people will also have\nlarge neck sizes and having a large neck\nsize or being overweight can also result in significant sleep apnea\nthat's why some of the best treatments for sleep apnea involved actually\nlifestyle modification and weight loss we should also be mindful that certain\nsubstances can make the airways a little more floppy and prone to sleep apnea\nalcohol or other sedating medications can increase sleep apnea\nand this is something also worth looking into and reducing before bed at night\npositional therapy can also be used to improve sleep apnea for some people\nsleeping on the back can result in significantly worse sleep apnea\nother people may choose to sleep on an incline or find that they sleep better\non an incline or in an airplane seat one other form of treatment for sleep\n\n00:05\napnea is a mandibular advancement device it's important to note that this is\nactually quite different than a typical night guard or mouth guard in the sense\nthat in addition to protecting the teeth it also works to move the lower jaw\nforward moving the lower jaw forward actually results in the tongue moving\nforward as well and when the tongue is more forward in the mouth\nit's less likely to fall back into the [Music] airway\n"}

month.", "understand your cash flow and when to spend more money.", "understand accounts receivable and accounts payable."], "transcript": "\n00:00\nbusiness finances can be a little complicated but once you've got the\nbasic concepts down you'll be well on your way to successfully managing your\nbusiness's income and expenses one of the first concepts you'll want to be\nfamiliar with is revenue revenue is the total dollar amount that your business\nearns in a given time period before subtracting expenses imagine you run a\nlemonade stand and you sell 100 glasses of lemonade for $1 per glass in a month\nyour revenue for that month would be $100 not all of that money goes into\nyour pocket though you also need to factor in the cost of goods sold or cogs\nfor short cogs is the amount you spend on materials in labor to produce your\ngoods or services for your lemonade stand your cogs would include the cost\n\n00:01\nof sugar lemons and cups if you need 50 lemons 100 cups and 25 cups of sugar to\nmake 100 glasses of lemonade and lemons are 25 cents each cups are ten cents\neach and cups of sugar are 15 cents each your cogs would be 26 dollars and 25\ncents once you know your cogs you can calculate the gross profit for your\nbusiness gross profit is the amount of money your business brings in in any\ngiven time period your revenue minus the cost of goods sold with the revenue for\nyour lemonade stand at $100 in the cogs at $26.25 the gross profit for your\nbusiness would be $100 minus twenty six dollars and twenty five cents or seventy\nthree dollars and seventy five cents however you still need to calculate one\nmore thing to determine how much of that\n\n00:02\nmoney will be going into your pocket and that's net profit net profit also known\nas your bottom-line is the amount of money your business earns in any given\ntime period minus expenses and the cost of goods sold\nfor your lemonade stand your expenses might include printing posters to\nadvertise your stand paying a friend to help you pass out the posters and buying\na wagon to carry your supplies say all of these expenses add up to $30 to\ncalculate net profit you would subtract your $30 expenses from your gross profit\nwhich is seventy three dollars and seventy five cents that would leave you\nwith forty three dollars and seventy five cents in net profit which you can\nput into your pocket or reinvest in your business something else you should keep\nin mind is your gross margin gross margin is the percentage of every dollar\nyou make that is gross profit the higher your gross margin the more profit you\n\n00:03\nmake with each sale to calculate gross margin just subtract your cogs from your\nrevenue and divide that number by your revenue for your lemonade stand you\nwould subtract the cost of goods sold or cogs $26.25 from your revenue 100\ndollars and then divide by that same revenue the gross margin for your\nlemonade stand would be seventy three percent meaning seventy three percent of\nevery dollar you take in is gross profit to keep track of all of these different\nnumbers as a business you'll want to use an income statement an income statement\nalso called a profit and loss statement shows the revenue expenses and net\nprofit for your business in a given period of time your lemonade stands\nincome statement would show how much you spent how much you earned and what your\n\n00:04\nnet profit or loss for the month is similarly you'll want to have a balance\nsheet a balance sheet shows the financial status of your business at a\ngiven time including your assets or things your business owns that are of\nvalue and liabilities which are your financial debts and obligations\nfor your lemonade stand the balance sheet would include things like how much\ncash is in your register and the wooden stand you own which are both assets as\nwell as the monthly payments you're making on the wagon which is a liability\nyour balance sheet can be used to determine how financially healthy your\nbusiness's a financially healthy business will have more assets than\nliabilities another concept you should be familiar with is cash flow cash flow\nis the movement of money in and out of your business within a 1 month period\n\n00:05\nits measured by comparing the amount of money your business has available at the\nbeginning of the month to cash available\nat the end of the month you can use your cash flow to determine when to spend\nmore money on your business for example you might buy more supplies for your\nlemonade stand at the beginning of the month when you have more cash on hand\nfinally you'll need to understand how accounts receivable and accounts payable\nwork accounts receivable is money that's owed to your business say your lemonade\nstand offers a promotion where customers can pay a monthly rate for unlimited\nlemonade in that case those monthly payments would be included in your\naccounts receivable their accounts payable on the other hand is money that\nyour business owes to its creditors if you have lemons delivered daily from a\nlocal farm for your lemonade stand your monthly lemon bill would be\nincluded in your accounts payable now that you understand the basics of\nbusiness finances you're ready to manage your money and grow your business\n"}

McClure and I'm\na clean Beauty artist entrepreneur and podcaster and today I'm going to show\nyou how to get a clean no makeup makeup so to start we're going to be using a\nfoundation but instead of a full coverage foundation we'll be using a\ntinted moisturizer so today I'm going to be sharing the sheer tinted moisturizer\nby rejuve amend rules I'll be using my fingers today and working the product\nend with my Beauty Blender so to start out with a tinted moisturizer you'll\nwant to start where you need the most coverage which is for me around the\ncenter of my nose my lips and under eye area so I'll work the product out like\nthat the key and trick to no makeup makeup is to not put it in places that\n\n00:01\nyou don't need I don't really need it on my cheeks because my cheeks are fine if\nyou have any blemishes that's when you'll go in with a concealer so for me\nI have a little tiny spot right here and another one here and the reason why I\nput a lot like that is because I'm gonna let it dry a little bit and I'm gonna\nshow you a trick so I'm just gonna put a little bit under my eyes we'll wait a\ncouple seconds and then just work the product in by patting not by swiping or\nyou'll take the product away from where you just wanted it and if you go too far\nup near your eye line your that's when the wrinkles start to happen that's when\nthe fine lines where the product stays and those so you want to make sure you\nuse as minimal product as possible especially when you're trying to achieve\na no makeup makeup step number two is powder so any powder will do you can\nskip powder but to make sure that it's going to stay on all day it's nice to\nalso reduce the shine in the middle of your nose chin and forehead as well so\n\n00:02\ntoday I'm going to be using gabriel cosmetics this compact actually comes\nwith a powder puff inside that you can use so I'll be showing you that today so\nhow you use a powder puff is pressing it in to the powder and then\nbringing it on to your face where you need it this is going to mattify meaning\nreduce and take away shine so I want to do that under my eyes on the tip of my\nnose and just a little bit on my forehead as well I want to go around my\nnose and a little bit on my chin next I'm going to be using a blush again if\nyou have drier skin you'll want to use a cream blush like I am if you have oily\nyour skin you'll be using something with more of a powder so I'm going to be\nusing freely ins I'm going to be taking a little bit of this cream right on my\nhand and as you can see you can barely see the color and this is a good color\n\n00:03\nfor no makeup makeup something that just enhances your natural rosy glow so how\nyou'll apply it is just use two fingers work it in make sure it's nice on your\nskin and then you'll Pat it you'll smile\nand just put it right where your natural plump of your cheek is so I also have a\npowder blush again in a very natural light shade and all you'll need to do is\nuse any little sponge or a brush and just Pat it onto your cheeks just like\nthat next if you want to highlight and illuminate your face but still look\nreally natural you'll want to use an illuminating cream otherwise called a\nhighlighter so again you'll want to apply it the same way using two fingers\nand just lightly patting it on top of your cheekbones wherever those might be\nand if you would like to highlight your nose if you have a smaller nose then you\nwould highlight here if you'd like to highlight your lip a little bit more you\ncan highlight the bow of your lips just like that so next you might want to use\n\n00:04\nan eyeliner so I'm going to be using this hint eyeliner and keeping the\npencil as close to my lash line as possible to make sure that it stays\nlooking very natural what this does is makes the eye\nlook like I have a thicker lash line you don't want to actually see the eyeliner\nthat's why it comes with this little tip that blends it seamlessly so you can't\ntell that you're wearing any eyeliner so next we're going to be using mascara so\nI have a couple different mascaras here one is a waterproof mascara so if you're\ngoing outside if it's hot where you live you plan on going in a pool or in the\nocean then you'll want to use waterproof mascara so that when the water touches\nit it doesn't actually bleed into your eye and irritate it\nso this one is rejuven isle ash remember you shouldn't be using a waterproof\n\n00:05\nmascara every day because it can damage your lashes over time so use a regular\nmascara for day to day wear when you're not near any water or sweating profusely\nor going to the gym I'm going to be using the hint Beauty mascara I'm just\ngoing to use the mascara to apply directly to the base of my lash just\nwiggling very slowly working my way out repeat that step each time in the new\narea and for the ends you'll want to rotate the brush up to get in the little\nhairs that are really hard to reach same thing for the bottom you can just use\nthe tip to enhance your eyelash line a little bit you want all of your lashes\nto look individually perfect without any mascara or clumps stuck to them if your\nmascara starts to look really clumpy then you know it's time for a new\nmascara so next you'll want to use a lipstick or a lip gloss depending on the\n\n00:06\nlook that you want so this one has a little bit of a tint to it again to\nmatch my cheek so I'm just going to be applying a\nlittle tiny bit of gloss just in the center and popping my lips together you\ncan do your entire lip but to make your lips look more plump you'll apply it\njust in the center also have affiliates clear lip gloss which is fun\nso if you aren't really looking for a color and your lips are already really\npretty and you can just use a clear too and enhance even more last but not least\nyou will want to use a setting spray or some sort of mist I love them so so much\nthis is a refreshing facial mist from freely ins once again see you'll just\nspray a little bit of that and that's gonna keep your makeup on all day and\nthis is how you achieve a beautiful natural makeup look [Music]\n"}

{"video_id": "uJqbE4H9lLk", "steps": ["Cleanse and exfoliate your skin.", "Apply a glycolic peel.", "Apply a ski food moisturizer.", "Apply a lip scrub.", "Remove any residue.", "Apply a toner.", "Apply mascara."], "transcript": "\n00:00\n[Music] hi I'm Cassandra McClure I'm a clean beauty artist\nentreprenuer and podcaster and today I'm going to show you how to give yourself\nan at-home facial to start we are going to use an exfoliating cleanser you\nshould be cleansing and exfoliating but this is a two-in-one\nthis is a white milk thistle and elderflower cleanser from codex Beauty\nso to start you'll just take a few drops on the tips of your fingers and gently\nmassage your entire face until everything is covered make sure to avoid\nyour eye area so you'll want to make sure to get enough and use circular\nmotions to really exfoliate your skin the reason why you want to exfoliate the\nskin is to slough off any makeup that's on your skin as well as the top layer of\n\n00:01\ndead skin so that your skin can be nice and radiant once you feel nice and\nexfoliated after about 60 seconds you can rinse with lukewarm water I'm going\nto be using this croon pad so I'll just blot this with some water\nand remove it just like that and the first step is almost done next we are\ngoing to do a peel there are several peels that you can buy there are\ncharcoal masks there are spray peels but today because we're in a hurry we're\ngonna do the spray this is from a company Juice Beauty to use the stem\ncellular exfoliating peel spray you will hold the bottle about a few inches from\nyour face and spray you'll let it sit for a second just patting it in making\nsure that it's all over your skin now remember I just did an exfoliation and\nyou're going to see even more dead skin and makeup come right off so you'll just\n\n00:02\nwant to rotate your fingers in a circular motion going across your face again\nso you'll start to see little balls of dead skin and makeup that you that was\nleft over from the exfoliation now you can remove it again using your croon so\nyou'll just want to clean it in some water and just rub it all in getting\neverything off so that you can move on to the next step\nso after your face is dry if you have blackheads around your nose chin or\nforehead area you'll want to get a glycolic pad or gel this is a brand\ncalled Alicia Marie skin and body now I get little blackheads in my nose because\nI wear makeup and dirt can naturally clog your pores even if you don't wear\nmakeup so you if you look closely in the mirror you might be able to see some\nblackheads so you'll use a peel like this every once in a while just to\n\n00:03\nreally get deep inside your pores and cleanse them out so once we are done\nwith the pad with the glycolic peel then we'll rinse one more time with fresh\nwater with a fresh Kroon or a sponge you can also use a\nregular washcloth as well so the next step is a really fun one I'm going to\nshow you how to use a lip scrub this is called lip looks you'll just put that on\nyour lips and just work it in just like you do with your face using circular\nmotions this sugar will start to dissolve and that's how you know that\nyour lips are really getting the nice exfoliation and it's okay if it goes\noutside of your lips as well once you're\ndone you'll also take the croon and just\nremove any excess product and we're neck ready for the next step\nI'm going to be using a toner that's in a mist form from Juice Beauty so you'll\n\n00:04\njust hold the bottle two or three inches after you shake it away from your face\nand you'll just spray gently all over your face neck and decollete so a toner\nactually closes back up your pores so that whatever you put on top it doesn't\nget clogged again we are going to be using a ski\nfood moisturizer from codex and this is just going to lock everything in and\nhydrate us for the rest of the day so I'm just going to take a little bit on\nthe back of my hand again use the same motions circular motions all the way\naround my face after applying your moisturizer and you can also do this\nwhen you have a peel on you can use a Jade roller a Jade roller is really\ngreat because it really can help to penetrate the product into your skin so\nyou'll just use light upward strokes and it comes with this side which is a\nlittle bit smaller for around your eye area so for the last step I am going to\n\n00:05\nbe using my new favorite lip balm by Mizzy cosmetics so I'm just gonna take a\nlittle bit and you can see the consistency here it's really thick stuff\nso this will last me like six or eight hours so that's how you give yourself an\nat-home facial and if you have drier skin like me you can always use an oil\nas well on top if you're still feeling a\nlittle dry but this is such a great base for makeup and if you are a makeup\nwearer and you're not finding that the makeup is really looking great on your\nskin make sure you give yourself an at-home facial first [Music]\n"}

civilization to earn victory\npoints the first player to earn 10 victory points wins the game\nplayers get one victory point for each settlement\nthey build two victory points for each city\nthey build two victory points if they build the longest road\nand two victory points for assembling the biggest army\nthere are also development cards that can give players\nvictory points to set up the game first shuffle the hexagonal terrain\npieces face down then randomly flip them over and make them\ninto a hexagon made of 19 terrain pieces there are five terrain types in katan\nincluding hills forest mountains fields pasture and desert\n\n00:01\nnext place the numbered water cards around the outside of the hexagon\nby placing one water hexagon against every other terrain\nwith the numbered side facing in towards the center\nfill in the blank spaces between the numbered water cards\nwith the blank water cards now randomly place the numbered tokens on\nthe terrain spaces skipping the desert and water spaces\nplace the robber token on the desert the terrain spaces\nproduce resources and provide cards that you collect\nto help you build the hills make brick forest makes lumber mountains make ore\nfields make grain pasture makes wool and desert doesn't produce anything\nseparate these resource cards into separate piles\nand set them face up next to the board shuffle the development cards and place\n\n00:02\nthem face down next to the resource cards every player\npicks a color to play and takes the road settlement and city pieces for their\ncolor each player rolls the dice and the player who rolls the highest number\ngoes first play moves clockwise around the table on the first turn\nplayers set one settlement at any intersection where three terrain hexes meet\nin one road on an adjacent line leading away from their settlement\nplayers may not place their first settlement on a junction that is\nadjacent to another player's settlement then going in reverse order players\nplace an additional settlement and road next\neach player receives one resource card for each terrain\nthat their second settlement borders for example\nif a player's second settlement is at the junction\n\n00:03\nwhere a mountain hex meets two forest texas they would take one ore card and two\nlumber cards now the player that placed the first settlement goes first\nto start a turn the active player rolls two dice the combined number on the dice\ndetermines which terrain hexes produce resources for that turn for example\nif a player rolls a six every hex with a token that says six on it\nmakes its resource any player that has a settlement\nin an adjacent junction gets one resource card\nfor that numbered hex if you have a city in the junction\nyou get two resource cards there are no hand size limits\nbut if a player rolls a seven the players with more than seven resource cards\ndiscard half of their resource cards also when a seven is rolled the player\nthat rolled it gets to move the robber token to any hex on the board\n\n00:04\nthe robber covers the numbered hex and that terrain produces no resources\nfor as long as the robber stays there even if the numbered token\nis rolled on the dice if there is a settlement or city on a junction\nwhere the robber is moved the player that moved the robber\nchooses one card at random from the owner's hand\nand steals it after the dice have been rolled\nand resource cards have been distributed the active player can trade resources\nwith other players trade with the bank or buy something\nthey can do any combination of these things on their turn\nany player trades are legal so long as both players agree\nhowever players cannot trade development cards\nto trade with the bank players must exchange four identical resource cards\nfor one card of any type if a player controls a settlement\non a port junction which is a port on a corner\n\n00:05\nof a numbered water hex they can use the ratio listed on that water hex\nto exchange resources with the bank instead\nfor example the player has a settlement or city\non the corner of the water hex that says three to one\nthey can trade three resource cards instead of four\nto get another card from the bank if there is a specific resource symbol on\nthe port that ratio only applies to trades for the matching resource\nplayers can also buy something on their turn\nto buy a road settlement or development card\nplayers follow the key on the building cost card to pay the bank for their piece\nfor example a player can pay one brick and one lumber to build a road when a\nplayer buys a piece they place it on the board immediately\nroads must be placed on a line between hexes and must connect to another road\n\n00:06\nsettlement or city the player owns players can only build one road on each line\nif they have the longest road in the game and it is at least six pieces long\nthey get the longest road card which is worth two victory points if someone else\nbuilds a longer road over the course of the game\nthey get that card to build a settlement a player must place it on an\nintersection between hexes that is connected by at least one road\nthey may not place a settlement on any junction where there is an\nexisting settlement and each adjacent junction must be empty for the player\nto place a settlement there players can only place cities by upgrading\nsettlements if they build a development card they can play it on their next turn\nplayers can only play one development card per turn\neach card has instructions on it but one of the most common and important cards\n\n00:07\nis the knight the knight allows players to move the robber to any terrain hex\nand steal a resource card of their choosing from the owner\nof an adjacent settlement or city when a player plays a knight they place\nit face up in front of them and leave it there it stays in place for\nthe remainder of the game if a player has more than three knights\nin front of them at any point of the game and they have the highest number of\nknights they get the largest army card this card is worth two victory points\nplay continues until one player gets 10

coach of dating\ntransformation calm and the dating coach with the league I'm going to give you a\nthree-part roadmap to have a great video\ndate first part is how to plan your date\nsecond part is how to look your best and the third part is how to have a great\ninteraction so let's start with planning your date tip number one is you want to\nset the date in advance so it feels like an event that you can both look forward\nto also you don't want to just grab your phone and call somebody without them\nexpecting you because you want to give them a chance to look their best so set\nit up in advance so you can both get excited about it\ntip number two is you want to choose a platform that you both use or that's\neasy for both of you to use so that might be a zoom chat if you both use\niPhones it could be a FaceTime chat or you could jump onto Facebook and do a\nvideo chat that way doesn't really matter what platform you use as long as\nit's easy for both of you to jump on and see each other face-to-face\n\n00:01\ntip number three is during the day leading up to the date send some\nmessages back and forth text some flirty messages hey I'm really excited to see\nyou tonight or I can't wait to watch that movie with you it's going to be\nexciting you want to build some anticipation so you're both thinking\nabout that date and thinking about each other and next you want to look your\nbest for your date so tip number one is you want to dress first date great this\nis a no sweatpants own wear the same thing you would wear if you were going\non a first date or a real-life date in-person and that goes from head to toe\neven your favorite shoes they make you feel attractive and sexy even if they\ndon't end up seeing you from the waist down it'll make you feel more attractive\nand feel more confident tip number two is you want to choose really good\nlighting lighting that flatters you so you want to avoid having lights set up\nfar above you or beneath you because that creates awkward unattractive\n\n00:02\nshadows you want to choose lighting that is on you roughly at or slightly above\nhead level so that you're looking your best and looking\nyour most attractive and tip number three is you want to choose a place in\nyour home where there's something going on behind you you don't want to stand or\nsit against a boring white wall that looks plain you want to have things\nbehind you like books records on the wall some sort of cool little personal\nchatzky in front of your date that gives\nthem something to talk about and it also brings them into your world and just\nmakes you look and feel like you're comfortable at home looking your best\nnow we're going to talk about three ways\nto make the interaction as enjoyable and\nas fun as possible tip number one is you want to make sure that occasionally you\nlook at the camera lens not just at the image of your date or at the image of\nyou in the corner of your screen you want to make sure your eyes toggle a\n\n00:03\nlittle bit back and forth from the lens to the video of your date lens to the\nvideo of your date this lets you look at your attractive date but also they'll\nsee you looking at them and it'll enhance connection if they feel like\nyou're looking at each other eye to eye tip number two is remember the two PS\nyou want to be positive and you want to be playful on a date look at Davis about\nfun it's about enjoying each other so sure there's a lot of negative things in\nthe world we could talk about but you want to keep things positive keep the\ntopics positive and fun and you also want to be a little bit playful dates\nare enjoyable they're about flirting getting to know each other having fun so\nremember those two P's positive and playful and the third tip is a great way\nto have a video date is have an activity that you're doing together maybe you're\nboth playing words with friends or using the Scrabble app or perhaps you're\ncooking together you can both choose the same cupcake recipe and bake the same\n\n00:04\ncupcakes at the same time just like you would in real life so a great way to\nmake a real deep connection and turn this video date into a date that's\nalmost as good as real-life is choose a fun activity that you can do at the same\ntime so in closing you want to basically treat your video date like you would a\nreal-life date you

"\n00:00\n[Music] how can i control my anger better um dr chloe take it away\nyeah so that's a great question um i i actually get a lot of clients with anger\nmanagement issues and i do just want to say first that um if\nyour anger is in any kind of a place where it causes you to think about\nphysical harm to yourself or others by all means you know please call 9-1-1 um\nthe types of anger management tips that i work with are usually more for people\nthat they maybe yell at someone or maybe they\nget snippy or maybe they get passive aggressive\num but the kinds of tips i'm talking about in general here\nare again are for those types of things and if you're ever at a place where you\nthink you could hurting anyone else yourself or anyone else\nyou know please call 9-1-1 or you know get get help for that\num but so to control your anger better um\ni would actually say the first thing to do in general\n\n00:01\nis to ironically congratulate yourself when you realize you're getting angry a\nlot of the anger management clients i work with\num have had negative experiences with their angry outbursts\nand so what they try to do is say i'm just gonna breathe\ni'm just going to take it easy i'm not going to get upset i'm not going to let\nthings get to me and then they end up just stuffing it all down\nuntil they end up having a big outburst and then the outburst actually only\nconfirms to them oh damn it you know why when i get angry things go\nsideways and so i'm just gonna try to stuff it harder down i'm just gonna not\nyou know get upset and then the cycle just keeps repeating and getting worse\nso what i encourage them to do is actually to pay attention to the anger and to\nwelcome the awareness of it when it's at\nlower levels because what we really want to do is have you learn how to express\nyourself when you're merely irritable when something is happening that's\nbothering you and you're not like totally crazy about it but you're\njust having an awareness that this is a friction point\nand that you want to talk about it um anger is usually assigned\n\n00:02\nin some ways that our boundaries are being a little bit crossed\nand so we have that you know need to learn how to articulate what's bothering\nus to think about the needs that we have and to figure out how to get them met\nthat's that's the healthy function of anger um so a thing you can do also is to\nyou know write down what's happening for you\num sometimes when we get really angry we can start to even lose our ability to\nput our feelings into words like that's why we\nhave that saying like i was just seeing red\nright like i just my my i couldn't even articulate what i needed or wanted\nand so sometimes just journaling and writing down like here's what happened\ntoday and here's why i'm so upset and then as you're writing you'll\nprobably be like yeah and then he did the same thing two weeks ago and\nthat's why i'm really angry and like you just jot it all down and really\nlike kind of make the case on paper as to why you're so angry and then\nsee if you can find a way to soften the message if appropriate\n\n00:03\num and you know talk to the person and say look i have to acknowledge you i\nfound myself getting pretty upset about x y and z and i wanted to just\nexplain why to see if you know we can agree on\nsomething different moving forward in the in this type of situation\nso again we control our anger making sure not to stuff it down\nbut really learning how to actually harness it and use it\nand i want to thank you again because i'll tell you i personally\nused to really eschew anger like i wanted to never be angry i thought\nanger was an ugly emotion this is me as a teenager i'm\nnot a teenager anymore and this was me pre-psychology training and pre-therapy\nso um but i i used to just think anger was\nan ugly emotion and i just didn't want to deal with it and what happened is i\nended up getting mistreated a lot by people\nbecause people would mistreat me and i would just try to be really nice\nand then i would build up a lot of just passive aggressive you know kind of\n\n00:04\nresentment or low expectations i would come to expect people to treat me poorly\nbecause i wasn't allowing my anger when i was encountering poor treatment\nto cause me to you know shift into setting better boundaries or ending the\nrelationship or asserting myself or whatever and so ironically again people who\ndon't want to actually learn how to deal with anger end up getting\nkind of bitter and resentful and it it actually breeds anger so what i\nfinally learned in therapy and with psychology training\nis that the best thing to do when we find ourselves getting angry\nis to assume that we might have some kind of good reason\nand then try to figure out how to describe what that reason is\nand then take some kind of healthy action around that uh reason and if\nthere's no reason and you can't find a reason and you know you're just angry\nthen i would encourage you to to go to therapy\nand and try to explore yourself and have someone ask you some\nprobing questions maybe to help you figure out why you're so angry [Music] you\n"}

{"video_id": "fvPczVNS7xo", "steps": ["Listen to the person tell their story and ask questions about the virus.", "Try to understand what the person mean by social distancing and sheltering in place.", "Get the person to practice social distancing measures, such as washing their hands thoroughly.", "If the person is sick, try to get them to stay at home or practice social distancing measures."], "transcript": "\n00:00\nin this video wikihow will interview expert virologist dr\nshannon bennett to learn how and why to stay healthy during the pandemic\nhow can we prevent the contraction and spread of covid19\nthe coronavirus is getting into our cells particularly our respiratory tissues\nso that means that we need to protect ourselves\nfrom introducing the virus into our respiratory tissues\nthis might mean for example avoiding people that are coughing or spraying\ndroplets this is why social distancing is so very important\nespecially if you yourself might be sick and potentially distributing virus\nthrough coughing or sneezing besides directly infecting each other through\na cough or sneeze for example is that sometimes we can deposit\nvirus on surfaces and then people can touch those surfaces\n\n00:01\npick them up on their hands and then introduce them to their respiratory tissues\nfor example touching their mucous membranes their eyes their nose their mouth\nwe don't think this virus can get into the body in any other way except\nmainly through respiratory tissues why is hand washing effective against\nthe virus the reason for why hand washing is so very effective with this virus\nis because it's an enveloped virus this envelope\nis a lipid or a fat based covering of the virus capsule that contains the\ngenetic information because it's lipid-based or fat-based\nit's actually disrupted by soap just like when you wash your greasy pots\nand pans with soap you break up the grease you break up the fat\nand so soap kills the virus by breaking up its fatty\n\n00:02\nouter membrane you want to wash for at least 20 seconds with\na lot of soap using soap when you wash your hands\nis the most important thing you don't need hot water\nbut the soap is critical and what you want to do is basically make sure that\nthe soap has good contact with all the parts of your hands\nand you want to wash between your fingers under your fingernails i'm not wearing\nany rings because i want to be able to wash my hands under my rings\nand even washing up to the first part of your wrist\nso moving your sleeves up and washing thoroughly\nbacks of hands palms between the fingers and under the nails\nfor at least 20 seconds we so often forget to wash our hands before we touch\nour eyes our nose or mouth after we've touched surfaces or other people's hands\nand what we want to do is get into the habit of washing very frequently\n\n00:03\nwhat does it mean to flatten the curve the curve actually refers to the\nchange in daily new cases over time during the course of an epidemic it\nstarts out with maybe a very few number of daily new cases\nas the epidemic is just first beginning and then as the growth rate increases\nthe reproductive number of the virus translates into many many new cases\nderiving from every one case you see exponential growth in the daily new cases\neventually those daily new cases will stop growing exponentially and they'll\nstart to level off and then they'll start to drop as the epidemic passes\nwe call it the passing of the epidemic wave so that's the curve\nthe rate at which the daily new cases grows the steepness of the leading edge of\nthat curve is what we're trying to change what impact does social distancing and\n\n00:04\nsheltering in place have on the curve when we talk about social distancing\nand shelter in place we're trying to reduce the steepness\nso that the doubling time of the new cases happens over a longer period and\nthat has two impacts the first main impact\nis that the number of new cases that are hitting our health care system\nat any one time is lower that might not reduce the total number of daily new\ncases but importantly the daily new cases\nwon't be hitting the health care system all at once\nin a way that over strips the health care system's ability to care for people\nand in places where we haven't been able to flatten the curve\nto come in under the healthcare capacity's ability\nto care for people we see this higher case fatality rate so it's really\nimportant to protect people from dying of this virus to flatten the curve\n\n00:05\nwe can do our part by not maybe going into a hospital setting where\nnot only are we more at risk at picking up an infection\nit also reduces the pressure on the healthcare system\nwhy will antibody tests help us understand the impact of coronavirus\none way to understand the true size of the number of infected people in\na population is to develop a test where we can look at where the virus\nhas been who has been infected and so this is getting away from being\ndependent on tests that only record the presence of active virus and\nactually look for the imprint of a past infection that the virus has\nmade on our immune system so when we're infected with a virus or another agent\nour body will mount an immune response we call it the adaptive immune response\nand one of the components of that immune response\n\n00:06\nis the production of antibodies that are specific\nto that pathogen or to that specific agent\nand so the antibody that we can detect in our system\nafter a coronavirus infection will be specific\nto that coronavirus the challenge is to identify what those antibodies are that\nare specific to covid19 and then develop a test to look for them\nas we begin to understand the true size of the number of infected people\nin our communities through antibody tests and virus tracer tests\nwe'll better be able to predict the trajectory of the virus and the amount\nof time we'll need to stay at home or remain socially distant though coven\n19 is a serious threatening disease we are not without means to protect\nourselves and those we love from infection\nremember to always wear a mask wash your hands thoroughly\n\n00:07\ndisinfect high touch surfaces and practice social distancing measures\nif we stay diligent we will be able to weather this virus together you\n"}

teach you how to properly drink\na glass of wine once you select your bottle open it pour\nit and swirl it before you get to drinking it\nfirst select your wine opener and open your bottle\nmy go-to opener is the basic waiter style corkscrew\nbecause it gives you the most control over the worm which is the curved\nmetal helix this control comes in handy when you are removing\nolder corks and need to be more gentle to open your wine\ncut around the aluminum cap below the lip of the bottle\ninsert the worm into the center of the cork and rotate the corkscrew into the\ncork draw the cork out with your lever and\n\n00:01\nwipe the neck of the bottle with a clean cloth to remove any sediment\nholding the neck of the bottle above your wine glass tilt the bottle gently\npast 90 degrees until a steady stream of wine pours out\nwhen you're nearly done with your pour rotate the bottom of your bottle away\nfrom you to catch any would-be droplets of wine\na standard pour is about 5 to 6 ounces [Music]\nthis can be done in many different ways but i like to place the bottom of the\nstem of my glass between my pointer finger and thumb\nlift my glass above the table top and move the wine gently in a\ncounterclockwise direction swirling is important because newly\nopened bottles may be a little tight-lipped\nwhen you swirl more of the wine surface area comes into contact with the air\nthe wine will open up alcohol will evaporate off the wine\n\n00:02\nlifting its aromas into the air and making it easier for you to smell\nnow for my favorite part drinking the wine you can gulp it down like a juice\nor you can really relish in your wine drinking\nexperience by thinking through three things sight smell and taste keep the wine\ngrape variety in mind as you enjoy your wine say you have your\nwell swirled glass right in front of you in a well-lit area lift it up\nand hold it against a white napkin to best observe its color\nbroadly speaking the color may clue you in on a few things\nincluding the age and the texture of the wine white wines are generally a lemon\nor lemon green color while red wines are generally purple or\nruby white or red wines that are browning have a few years of age on them\nwhile most wines have great clarity wines that are hazy or have sediment\n\n00:03\nin them may have a fuller body and weightier mouth feel\nup next is smell lift the rim of your glass up to your nose\nswirl the glass so the roam is lift upwards and take a deep breath\nin as you do try to pick out wine aromas that may fit into one of the following\nsix categories fruits florals vegetables spices minerality and oak imparted\naromas not sure how to begin naming what you're\nsmelling start with the wine's color generally speaking a white wine is more\nlikely to smell of fruits with similar colors\nsuch as lemons pears and oranges in the same vein\nred wines are more likely to smell of raspberries strawberries and cherries\nlastly we have taste hold your wine glass up to your lips\ndrink a sip of wine and swirl it around your mouth for a few seconds\ncoating the roof of your mouth and your whole tongue think through the same\n\n00:04\ncategories you did when trying to pick out the aromas in a wine\none tip i give to my students is really pay attention to the spice category here\nspices are easier to taste than to smell oftentimes the aromas on your nose will\nbe similar to the flavors on your tongue grape varieties tend to exhibit certain\naromas and flavors and be known to have certain elements\nas you taste also consider the different elements of a wine\nis it dry or sweet light or full bodied low or high in acidity tannin and\nalcohol does it have a short or long finish\ndo this with each of the international wine varieties i recommended\nand you'll be well on your way to understanding wine\n"}
