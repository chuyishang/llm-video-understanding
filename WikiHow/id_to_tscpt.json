how\nwill interview expert virologist dr. Shannon Bennett to learn about the\nproperties of this virus and how it affects your body\nI'm dr. Shannon Bennett at the California Academy of Sciences where I'm\nchief of science and dean of science and research collections I'm also an\nassociate curator of microbiology with a specialty in viruses and an expert on\nstudying how infectious diseases jumped from animals to humans\npart one virus basics what is a virus so embarrass is a very small particle of\ngenetic material packaged in a capsule that's a protein-based capsule the\n\n00:01\nenveloped viruses which stars coronavirus to is one of there's a\nmembrane around that capsule that's made up of fatty elements and then sticking\noutside of that envelope of fatty elements are proteins and these proteins\nare critical for how the virus gets into the host so the one thing about a virus\nis that it cannot copy itself without being inside of a host cell how does the\nvirus come into contact with a host cell the hotel is covered with receptors\nwhich are almost like a lock and the virus protein is like a key and that\nbond between the key of the virus and the lock of the host cell is very\nspecific and highly evolved in some cases to make sure that the virus gets\ninto only certain kinds of host cells with this corona virus the key is called\n\n00:02\nthe Spike protein and it binds to the host cell receptor the lock specifically\nthe bind is to host respiratory cells and the receptor is called a stew so\nonce the virus makes that lock and key relationship with the host cell it can\nenter into the host cell and do its thing\nhow does the virus spread viruses spread\nbetween hosts in ways that are basically determined by the kinds of cells that\nthey infect when they infect a host so for example viruses that infect\nrespiratory cells like stars coronavirus - are spread through the product of our\nrespiration system so coughing and sneezing and the droplets that we've\nproduced from deep in our lungs or even in our upper respiratory tract are key\nelements for how this virus spreads between people part two properties of\n\n00:03\nKovan 19 how does Kovan 19 the body when the\nhuman body is first infected we develop an innate immune response one of the\nprimary defense mechanisms that our body\nelicits is fever 88% of infectious cases that develop symptoms have fever they\nalso developed dry cough fatigue and ultimately can progress to these severe\nviral pneumonia type symptoms according to the CDC symptoms may also\ninclude chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat\nand loss of taste or smell what is the reproductive number of a virus the\nreproductive number of a pathogen is how we measure how infectious it is it can\n\n00:04\nbe seen as how many new infections does a single infected person give rise to so\nif the reproductive number is one that means every infected individual can\npotentially infect one other person if the reproductive number is less than one\neventually the disease will die out if the reproductive number is greater than\none the disease grows exponentially so in the case of SARS coronavirus to the\nreproductive number is being estimated on average at about two point five and\nthat means that every single individual that's infected can potentially infect\ntwo and a half on average new people so this is a very contagious virus and it's\ngrowing exponentially what is an incubation period of a virus the\nincubation period of a virus is the time between when a person is exposed and\n\n00:05\ninfected to when they develop symptoms and the challenge with this corona virus\nis that period is highly variable it seems to span anywhere from 1 to 14 days\nin some cases the incubation period is the time prior to symptoms when the\nviruses are not being efficiently spread from person to person that is not the\ncase with coded 19 people that are still\nincubating the virus prior to developing symptoms can infect other people what\ndoes it mean to be asymptomatic what's very tricky about this virus is\nthat many people don't develop symptoms or if they do they're very mild and they\neven go unnoticed so we call those infections asymptomatic SARS coronavirus\ntoo has a high reproductive number and a long incubation period even if you do\nnot feel sick you may still be able to transmit the virus to other people\n\n00:06\nduring the incubation period or as an asymptomatic carrier of the virus part 3\nreview a virus is an infectious agent made up of genetic material packaged in\na protein capsule viruses can only multiply if they successfully infect\nhost cells the protein of a

means a cessation of\nbreathing and sleep apnea is when people have pauses or cessation of breathing\nduring the night in their sleep the most common things we hear in people with\nsleep apnea is their partner will say that\nthey were snoring very loudly at night but not everybody that snores has sleep\napnea and not everybody that has sleep apnea snores\nmore commonly people will say they wake up a lot of times during the night\nto roll over or change sides on the bed but people will also often say that they\nwake up often to use the bathroom during the night\nand some people will think that they have prostate issues or they drank too\nmuch water but the reality is that their sleep is\nnot deep broken unrefreshing sleep results in significant daytime fatigue\nand in some cases sleepiness some of us will compensate by drinking\nlarge amounts of caffeine to not have those symptoms\n\n00:01\nother symptoms of sleep apnea include elevated blood pressure\nincreased anxiety for some people increased impulsivity which can also result in\nsymptoms that might look like adhd people that don't have\nregular solid sleep will often report significant problems with memory during\nthe day trouble with attention and focus and also trouble remembering things in\ngeneral beyond the mental effects of sleep apnea broken up sleep also results in\nsignificant biological effects a lot of times people will experience\nweight gain and increase carbohydrate craving because that's what the body\ndoes when it's tired during the day usually the first person to notice it is\nyour bed partner bed partners will often notice that someone is\nhaving episodes of not breathing during the night or loud snoring during the\nnight beyond your bed partner at home we'll\noften encourage our patients to use apps\nwhich may be able to record audio during the night\npeople will often listen to recordings of themselves at night and be able to\ntell if they have pauses and breathing or loud very labored breathing being\n\n00:02\naware that you wake up numerous times during the night can often be suggestive\nof sleep apnea once somebody does suspect they have sleep apnea the best\ninitial step is to get in touch with either your primary care physician or\na sleep specialist once a referral has been made for a sleep study there's two\ntypes of sleep studies that can be made there's one that's at home and there's\none that you can do in the lab they're both called polysomnography\nthe home sleep test is usually the easiest and most unobtrusive\npeople take home a device that looks about the size of a smartphone\nand the device during the night will monitor airflow through their nose\nhow their pulse oximetry blood oxygen levels are during the night\nand it'll also track how their chest is moving during the night the test is\npretty painless and straightforward and you'll often bring it back to the sleep\nlab or your sleep doctor and have that recording analyzed and\ndetermined if you have sleep apnea in lab testing is a little bit more\nadvanced and it involves sleeping over or spending the night in a sleep\nlab the main difference between a home sleep test and an\nin lab's sleep study is that during the in lab sleep study they'll also track\n\n00:03\nbrain wave activity in addition to leg movements and muscle tone in other parts\nof the body oftentimes these studies are a bit more\ncomprehensive but they're also more onerous and that not many people like\nsleeping in a lab sleep apnea is really a problem of air\nflow so it's important to recognize all the different parts of the airflow where\nit could get interrupted the most common form of treatment for\nsleep apnea is cpap cpap stands for continuous positive airway pressure\nand it's important to note that cpap machines don't really deliver oxygen\nthey're actually delivering room air they're very quiet and minimalist these\ndays and the masks have actually gotten quite small themselves\nthis is one example of a nasal pillow mask which actually fits over the head\nlike this and will actually enable you to breathe during the night using a cpap\na lot of people choose to use this kind of mask but there's other kind of masks\nas well in the end people will often report\nsleeping better through the night having better energy during the day and fewer\nawakenings while they sleep people with sleep apnea sometimes will\nhave really congested noses and they'll be mouth breathing during the day\nso having allergies corrected and having a being able to breathe well\n\n00:04\nthrough your nose during the night can be the beginning of treating sleep apnea\nthe tongue and throat are other areas that can often be involved in sleep apnea\nsome people have a really small jaw and they'll often say that they've had teeth\nextracted as children or their teeth will be really crowded\nand they'll have had braces at some point in their lives\nhaving a small jaw results in the tongue sitting further back in the throat\nand that in turn can also obstruct the airway people will also have\nlarge neck sizes and having a large neck\nsize or being overweight can also result in significant sleep apnea\nthat's why some of the best treatments for sleep apnea involved actually\nlifestyle modification and weight loss we should also be mindful that certain\nsubstances can make the airways a little more floppy and prone to sleep apnea\nalcohol or other sedating medications can increase sleep apnea\nand this is something also worth looking into and reducing before bed at night\npositional therapy can also be used to improve sleep apnea for some people\nsleeping on the back can result in significantly worse sleep apnea\nother people may choose to sleep on an incline or find that they sleep better\non an incline or in an airplane seat one other form of treatment for sleep\n\n00:05\napnea is a mandibular advancement device it's important to note that this is\nactually quite different than a typical night guard or mouth guard in the sense\nthat in addition to protecting the teeth it also works to move the lower jaw\nforward

podcaster and today I'm going to show you how to give yourself\nan at-home facial to start we are going to use an exfoliating cleanser you\nshould be cleansing and exfoliating but this is a two-in-one\nthis is a white milk thistle and elderflower cleanser from codex Beauty\nso to start you'll just take a few drops on the tips of your fingers and gently\nmassage your entire face until everything is covered make sure to avoid\nyour eye area so you'll want to make sure to get enough and use circular\nmotions to really exfoliate your skin the reason why you want to exfoliate the\nskin is to slough off any makeup that's on your skin as well as the top layer of\n\n00:01\ndead skin so that your skin can be nice and radiant once you feel nice and\nexfoliated after about 60 seconds you can rinse with lukewarm water I'm going\nto be using this croon pad so I'll just blot this with some water\nand remove it just like that and the first step is almost done next we are\ngoing to do a peel there are several peels that you can buy there are\ncharcoal masks there are spray peels but today because we're in a hurry we're\ngonna do the spray this is from a company Juice Beauty to use the stem\ncellular exfoliating peel spray you will hold the bottle about a few inches from\nyour face and spray you'll let it sit for a second just patting it in making\nsure that it's all over your skin now remember I just did an exfoliation and\nyou're going to see even more dead skin and makeup come right off so you'll just\n\n00:02\nwant to rotate your fingers in a circular motion going across your face again\nso you'll start to see little balls of dead skin and makeup that you that was\nleft over from the exfoliation now you can remove it again using your croon so\nyou'll just want to clean it in some water and just rub it all in getting\neverything off so that you can move on to the next step\nso after your face is dry if you have blackheads around your nose chin or\nforehead area you'll want to get a glycolic pad or gel this is a brand\ncalled Alicia Marie skin and body now I get little blackheads in my nose because\nI wear makeup and dirt can naturally clog your pores even if you don't wear\nmakeup so you if you look closely in the mirror you might be able to see some\nblackheads so you'll use a peel like this every once in a while just to\n\n00:03\nreally get deep inside your pores and cleanse them out so once we are done\nwith the pad with the glycolic peel then we'll rinse one more time with fresh\nwater with a fresh Kroon or a sponge you can also use a\nregular washcloth as well so the next step is a really fun one I'm going to\nshow you how to use a lip scrub this is called lip looks you'll just put that on\nyour lips and just work it in just like you do with your face using circular\nmotions this sugar will start to dissolve and that's how you know that\nyour lips are really getting the nice exfoliation and it's okay if it goes\noutside of your lips as well once you're\ndone you'll also take the croon and just\nremove any excess product and we're neck ready for the next step\nI'm going to be using a toner that's in a mist form from Juice Beauty so you'll\n\n00:04\njust hold the bottle two or three inches after you shake it away from your face\nand you'll just spray gently all over your face neck and decollete so a toner\nactually closes back up your pores so that whatever you put on top it doesn't\nget clogged again we are going to be using a ski\nfood moisturizer from codex and this is just going to lock everything in and\nhydrate us for the rest of the day so I'm just going to take a little bit on\nthe back of my hand again use the same motions circular motions all the way\naround my face after applying your moisturizer and you can also do this\nwhen you have a peel on you can use a Jade roller a Jade roller is really\ngreat because it really can help to penetrate the product into your skin so\nyou'll just use light upward strokes and it comes with this side which is a\nlittle bit smaller for around your eye area so for the last step I am going to\n\n00:05\nbe using my new favorite lip balm by Mizzy cosmetics so I'm just gonna take a\nlittle bit and you can see the consistency here it's really thick stuff\nso this will last me like six or eight hours so that's how you give yourself an\nat-home facial and if you have drier skin like me you can always use an oil\nas well on top if you're still feeling a\nlittle dry but this is such a great base for makeup and if you are a

sleeping but people that also have trouble sleeping\nmight sometimes feel that they're depressed first and most important\ndistinction to make is if you're tired or actually depressed\nthe main way we tell between someone being sleepy or depressed is actually by\ntheir desire to do things in my work here i've often found that\npeople that are tired tend to say that they actually want to do things but\ndon't have the energy to do so on the other end people that are\ndepressed will often say that they are actually just not\ninterested in doing things a good mnemonic to use for understanding\ndepression is called ciggy caps and sticky caps involves the following\nsymptoms people with depression will often experience trouble with sleep\nthey'll also experience periods of diminished interest or diminished activity\nthey may feel periods of time where they\nfeel guilty over not being active or not participating in life\n\n00:01\nas they should at times people feel like their energy is low\ntheir concentration is poor their appetite may be diminished\nthey might also experience psychomotor symptoms such as slowing\nof either body movements or thinking and lastly people with depression may at\ntimes experience suicidal thoughts the mnemonic ziggy caps actually tells\nus the common symptoms of depression for people that are depressed and having\ntrouble sleeping or for people that have trouble sleeping\nin general there's a couple of recommendations that often help a lot\nfirst of all keeping to a regular bed and wake time helps tremendously\ntry to keep your bedtime regular and try to wake up at the same time each day\nin the morning sunlight is important as well as vertical activity\nduring the day we'll often encourage our patients to be as active as possible\nduring the day exercise if possible and try to eat\nhealthy during the day as well the evening routine is important too and\nit's important to start slowing down at night\nmaybe take a hot bath or a shower before going to bed\nand avoid any kind of exercise or caffeine before going to sleep\n\n00:02\ncaffeine actually should be avoided any time after 12 o'clock in the day\nand even earlier for people that have trouble sleeping or unrefreshing sleep\nat night a lot of things in psychiatry ultimately\ndepend on how impairing the symptoms are if your depression is bad enough that\nyou're not able to function well during the day\nor your sleep is completely unrefreshing and broken up or excessive during the\nnight it might be time to speak to a health\nprofessional if you're suffering from depression it's worth noting that you're\nnot alone and that there is hope depression is actually fairly common one\nin four women at some point in their lives may experience

to drinking it\nfirst select your wine opener and open your bottle\nmy go-to opener is the basic waiter style corkscrew\nbecause it gives you the most control over the worm which is the curved\nmetal helix this control comes in handy when you are removing\nolder corks and need to be more gentle to open your wine\ncut around the aluminum cap below the lip of the bottle\ninsert the worm into the

the bottle above your wine glass tilt the bottle gently\npast 90 degrees until a steady stream of wine pours out\nwhen you're nearly done with your pour rotate the bottom of your bottle away\nfrom you to catch any would-be droplets of wine\na standard pour is about 5 to 6 ounces [Music]\nthis can be done in many different ways but i like to place the bottom of the\nstem of my glass between my pointer finger and thumb\nlift my glass above the table top and move the wine gently in a\ncounterclockwise direction swirling is important because newly\nopened bottles may be a little tight-lipped\nwhen you swirl more of the wine surface area comes into contact with the air\nthe wine will open up alcohol will evaporate off the wine\n\n00:02\nlifting its aromas into the air and

things sight smell and taste keep the wine\ngrape variety in mind as you enjoy your wine say you have your\nwell swirled glass right in front of you in a well-lit area lift it up\nand hold it against a white napkin to best observe its color\nbroadly speaking the color may clue you in on a few things\nincluding the age and the texture of the wine white wines are generally a lemon\nor lemon green color while red wines are generally purple or\nruby white or red wines that are browning have a few years of age on them\nwhile most wines have great clarity wines that are hazy or have

naming what you're\nsmelling start with the wine's color generally speaking a white wine is more\nlikely to smell of fruits with similar colors\nsuch as lemons pears and oranges in the same vein\nred wines are more likely to smell of raspberries strawberries and cherries\nlastly we have taste hold your wine glass up to your lips\ndrink a sip of wine and swirl it around your mouth for a few seconds\ncoating the roof of your mouth and your whole tongue think through the same\n\n00:04\ncategories you did when trying to pick out the aromas in a wine\none tip i give to my students is really

certain\naromas and flavors and be known to have certain elements\nas you taste also consider the different elements of a wine\nis it dry or sweet light or full bodied low or high in acidity tannin

of you to use so that might be a zoom chat if you both use\niPhones it could be a FaceTime chat or you could jump onto Facebook and do a\nvideo chat that way doesn't really matter what platform you use as long as\nit's easy for both of you to jump on and see each other face-to-face\n\n00:01\ntip number three is during the day leading up to the date send some\nmessages back and forth text some flirty messages hey I'm really excited to see\nyou tonight or I can't wait to watch that movie with you it's going to be\nexciting you want to build some anticipation so you're both thinking\nabout that date and thinking about each other and next you want to look your\nbest for your date so tip number one is you want to dress first date great this\nis a no sweatpants own wear the same thing you would wear if you were going\non a first date or a real-life date in-person and that goes from head to toe\neven your favorite shoes they make you feel attractive and sexy even if they\ndon't end up seeing you from the waist down it'll make you feel more attractive\nand feel more confident tip number two is you want to choose really good\nlighting lighting that flatters you so you want to avoid having lights set up\nfar above you or beneath you because that creates awkward unattractive\n\n00:02\nshadows you want to choose lighting that is on you roughly at or slightly above\nhead level so that you're looking your best and looking\nyour most attractive and tip number three is you want to choose a place in\nyour home where there's something going on behind you you don't want to stand or\nsit against a boring white wall that looks plain you want to have things\nbehind you like books records on the wall some sort of cool little personal\nchatzky in front of your date that gives\nthem something to talk about and it also brings them into your world and just\nmakes you look and feel like you're comfortable at home looking your best\nnow we're going to talk about three ways\nto make the interaction as enjoyable and\nas fun as possible tip number one is you want to make sure that occasionally you\nlook at the camera lens not just at the image of your date or at the image of\nyou in the corner of your screen you want to make sure your eyes toggle a\n\n00:03\nlittle bit back and forth from the lens to the video of your date lens to the\nvideo of your date this lets you look at your attractive date but also they'll\nsee you looking at them and it'll enhance connection if they feel like\nyou're looking at each other eye to eye tip number two is remember the two PS\nyou want to be positive and you want to be playful on a date look at Davis about\nfun it's about enjoying each other so sure there's a lot of negative things in\nthe world we could talk about but you want to keep things positive keep the\ntopics positive and fun and you also want to be a little bit playful dates\nare enjoyable they're about flirting getting to know each other having fun so\nremember those two P's positive and playful and the third tip is a great way\nto have a video date is have an activity that you're doing together maybe you're\nboth playing words with friends or using the Scrabble app or perhaps you're\ncooking together you can both choose the same cupcake recipe and bake the same\n\n00:04\ncupcakes at the same time just like you would in real life so a great way to\nmake a real deep connection and turn this video date into a date that's\nalmost as good as real-life is choose a fun activity that you can do at the same\ntime so in closing you want to basically treat your video date like you would a\nreal-life date you want to look your best you want to keep that eye contact and\nassistant you want to be playful and positive and you want to do a fun\nactivity together if you do all these things then I guarantee you your video\ndates going to be just as good as an in real life date and you're going to make\na fantastic connection you got this

just say okay try to be happy\nyou could just smile and try to put on a happy face but that's not gonna really\nmake you happy in a deep meaningful way it's sort of just pretending to be happy\nand and most of what we do with motivation is just\nwe try to force ourselves to do things which is sort of the same thing as just\nputting on a fake smile when we're forcing ourselves to do\nsomething we're not actually motivated to do that\nwe're just sort of attempting to motivate so it turns out that motivation\nis much more wrapped up and linked into our fundamental well-being\nwhen we're feeling good we're gonna be more\n\n00:01\nmotivated because our energy's gonna be up we're gonna be filled with vitality\nif you think about the opposite of this if you feel depressed someone who's very\ndepressed is someone who can't get out of bed they can't\nmotivate because they have no energy so the first question we need to ask about\nmotivation is how do we cultivate a well-being how do we\nincrease our energy so that we have this reservoir of energy to go out and take\naction humans are kind of simple creatures we have three fundamental human needs\npsychological needs that when when they get met we feel happier we feel\nmore energized and we have more motivation\nso what are those three needs the first one is relatedness\nthis is something that as an educator we can really lean into\nwe are inextricably intertwined with our\nstudents we have relationships with them\nso the question is what's the quality of those relationships are we being\n\n00:02\nsupportive are we being encouraging are we being helpful\nor not if you ask any student which classes they do better in and which\nclasses they struggle more in across the board you're going to find\nkids say they do better when they like their teachers and when their teachers\nlike them that's a relatedness factor so we want to\nreally focus on cultivating meaningful supportive relationships\nand that's going to increase motivation a second one\nis autonomy and autonomy really has to do with empowering people to make\nchoices for themselves that feel aligned with who they are\nrather than forcing them or controlling them or dictating their behavior for\nthem in my practice with students i am constantly trying to offer\ninput so that they can make good decisions that are informed\nbut not make those decisions ultimately for them\nthere's a whole body of research around autonomy support\nwhether it's in healthcare pro-sports education business on and on\n\n00:03\nwhere when people feel more supported in their autonomy the outcomes are better\nthey are more engaged they are more motivated\nand they perform at higher levels and the final\nand third fundamental human need is the need for competence\ncompetence especially in a school or educational setting has to do with\nperforming well yes but it also has to do with\nlearning the best thing i can say the simplest core\nidea about supporting competence is about scaffolding instruction\nin an appropriate way if people can learn in a step-by-step manner\nat the level at an appropriate level of challenge for them\nthen they can get it and they feel good about themselves and it increases their\nmotivation and it builds a positive cycle if they don't feel\nchallenged enough that's usually not the problem but if they don't feel\nchallenged enough they lose interest and get bored and\n\n00:04\ndisengage and that's not motivating and if they feel\noverly challenged they feel like they can't get it\nand they feel stress and anxiety and they get overwhelmed and then they lose\nmotivation because they don't believe in themselves\nso we have to keep them in that sort of middle sweet spot\nof just challenging enough but not too challenging\nfor optimal what's called scaffolding we're going to need some customization and\nhave some leeway to empower them to find their own sweet spot\nand to modulate that as they go so just as a quick recap if we\ntake steps as educators to be relational to be supportive to be encouraging to\nallow students to have their autonomy intact to make\nchoices for themselves that are healthy and to learn in optimal environments\nthey're going to thrive as individuals and motivation will be the natural\noutcome when we meet people's needs when we help them get their needs

and podcaster and today I'm going to show\nyou how to get a clean no makeup makeup so to start we're going to be using a\nfoundation but instead of a full coverage foundation we'll be using a\ntinted moisturizer so today I'm going to be sharing the sheer tinted moisturizer\nby rejuve amend rules I'll be using my fingers today and working the product\nend with my Beauty Blender so to start out with a tinted moisturizer you'll\nwant to start where you need the most coverage which is for me around the\ncenter of my nose my lips and under eye area so I'll work the product out like\nthat the key and trick to no makeup makeup is to not put it in places that\n\n00:01\nyou don't need I don't really need it on my cheeks because my cheeks are fine if\nyou have any blemishes that's when you'll go in with a concealer so for me\nI have a little tiny spot right here and another one here and the reason why I\nput a lot like that is because I'm gonna let it dry a little bit and I'm gonna\nshow you a trick so I'm just gonna put a little bit under my eyes we'll wait a\ncouple seconds and then just work the product in by patting not by swiping or\nyou'll take the product away from where you just wanted it and if you go too far\nup near your eye line your that's when the wrinkles start to happen that's when\nthe fine lines where the product stays and those so you want to make sure you\nuse as minimal product as possible especially when you're trying to achieve\na no makeup makeup step number two is powder so any powder will do you can\nskip powder but to make sure that it's going to stay on all day it's nice to\nalso reduce the shine in the middle of your nose chin and forehead as well so\n\n00:02\ntoday I'm going to be using gabriel cosmetics this compact actually comes\nwith a powder puff inside that you can use so I'll be showing you that today so\nhow you use a powder puff is pressing it in to the powder and then\nbringing it on to your face where you need it this is going to mattify meaning\nreduce and take away shine so I want to do that under my eyes on the tip of my\nnose and just a little bit on my forehead as well I want to go around my\nnose and a little bit on my chin next I'm going to be using a blush again if\nyou have drier skin you'll want to use a cream blush like I am if you have oily\nyour skin you'll be using something with more of a powder so I'm going to be\nusing freely ins I'm going to be taking a little bit of this cream right on my\nhand and as you can see you can barely see the color and this is a good color\n\n00:03\nfor no makeup makeup something that just enhances your natural rosy glow so how\nyou'll apply it is just use two fingers work it in make sure it's nice on your\nskin and then you'll Pat it you'll smile\nand just put it right where your natural plump of your cheek is so I also have a\npowder blush again in a very natural light shade and all you'll need to do is\nuse any little sponge or a brush and just Pat it onto your cheeks just like\nthat next if you want to highlight and illuminate your face but still look\nreally natural you'll want to use an illuminating cream otherwise called a\nhighlighter so again you'll want to apply it the same way using two fingers\nand just lightly patting it on top of your cheekbones wherever those might be\nand if you would like to highlight your nose if you have a smaller nose then you\nwould highlight here if you'd like to highlight your lip a little bit more you\ncan highlight the bow of your lips just like that so next you might want to use\n\n00:04\nan eyeliner so I'm going to be using this hint eyeliner and keeping the\npencil as close to my lash line as possible to make sure that it stays\nlooking very natural what this does is makes the eye\nlook like I have a thicker lash line you don't want to actually see the eyeliner\nthat's why it comes with this little tip that blends it seamlessly so you can't\ntell that you're wearing any eyeliner so next we're going to be using mascara so\nI have a couple different mascaras here one is a waterproof mascara so if you're\ngoing outside if it's hot where you live you plan on going in a pool or in the\nocean then you'll want to use waterproof mascara so that when the water touches\nit it doesn't actually bleed into your eye and irritate it\nso this one is rejuven isle ash remember you shouldn't be using a waterproof\n\n00:05\nmascara every day because it can damage your lashes over time so use a regular\nmascara for day to day wear when you're not near any water or sweating profusely\nor going to the gym I'm going to be using the hint Beauty mascara I'm just\ngoing to use the mascara to apply directly to the base of my lash just\nwiggling very slowly working my way out repeat that step each time in the new\narea and for the ends you'll want to rotate the brush up to get in the little\nhairs that are really hard to reach same thing for the bottom you can just use\nthe tip to enhance your eyelash line a little bit you want all of your lashes\nto look individually perfect without any mascara or clumps stuck to them if your\nmascara starts to look really clumpy then you know it's time for a new\nmascara so next you'll want to use a lipstick or a lip gloss depending on the\n\n00:06\nlook that you want so this one has a little bit of a tint to it again to\nmatch my cheek so I'm just going to be applying a\nlittle tiny bit of gloss just in the center and popping my lips together you\ncan do your entire lip but to make your lips look more plump you'll apply it\njust in the center also have affiliates clear lip gloss which is fun\nso if you aren't really looking for a color and your lips are already really\npretty and you can just use a clear too and enhance even more

the curve\nto come in under the healthcare capacity's ability\nto care for people we see this higher case fatality rate so it's really\nimportant to protect people from dying of this virus to flatten

look at where the virus\nhas been who has been infected and so this is getting away from being\ndependent on tests that only record the presence of active virus and\nactually look for the imprint of a past infection that the virus has\nmade on our immune system so when we're infected with a virus or another agent\nour body will mount an immune response we call it the adaptive immune response\nand one of the components of that immune response\n\n00:06\nis the production of antibodies that are specific\nto that pathogen or to that specific agent\nand so the antibody that we can detect in our system\nafter a coronavirus infection will be specific\nto that coronavirus the challenge is to identify what those antibodies are that\nare specific to covid19 and then develop a test to look for them\nas we begin to understand the true size of the number of infected people\nin our communities through antibody tests and virus tracer tests\nwe'll better be able to predict the trajectory of the

concepts down you'll be well on your way to successfully managing your\nbusiness's income and expenses one of the first concepts you'll want to be\nfamiliar with is revenue revenue is the total dollar amount that your business\nearns in a given time period before subtracting expenses imagine you run a\nlemonade stand and you sell 100 glasses of lemonade for $1 per glass in a month\nyour revenue for that month would be $100 not all of that money goes into\nyour pocket though you also need to factor in the cost of goods sold or cogs\nfor short cogs is the amount you spend on materials in labor to produce your\ngoods or services for your lemonade stand your cogs would include the cost\n\n00:01\nof sugar lemons and cups if you need 50 lemons 100 cups and 25 cups of sugar to\nmake 100 glasses of lemonade and lemons are 25 cents each cups are ten cents\neach and cups of sugar are 15 cents each your cogs would be 26 dollars and 25\ncents once you know your cogs you can calculate the gross profit for your\nbusiness gross profit is the amount of money your business brings in in any\ngiven time period your revenue minus the cost of goods sold with the revenue for\nyour lemonade stand at $100 in the cogs at $26.25 the gross profit for your\nbusiness would be $100 minus twenty six dollars and twenty five cents or seventy\nthree dollars and seventy five cents however you still need to calculate one\nmore thing to determine how much of that\n\n00:02\nmoney will be going into your pocket and that's net profit net profit also known\nas your bottom-line is the amount of money your business earns in any given\ntime period minus expenses and the cost of goods sold\nfor your lemonade stand your expenses might include printing posters to\nadvertise your stand paying a friend to help you pass out the posters and buying\na wagon to carry your supplies say all of these expenses add up to $30 to\ncalculate net profit you would subtract your $30 expenses from your gross profit\nwhich is seventy three dollars and seventy five cents that would leave you\nwith forty three dollars and seventy five cents in net profit which you can\nput into your pocket or reinvest in your business something else you should keep\nin mind is your gross margin gross margin is the percentage of every dollar\nyou make that is gross profit the higher your gross margin the more profit you\n\n00:03\nmake with each sale to calculate gross margin just subtract your cogs from your\nrevenue and divide that number by your revenue for your lemonade stand you\nwould subtract the cost of goods sold or cogs $26.25 from your revenue 100\ndollars and then divide by that same revenue the gross margin for your\nlemonade stand would be seventy three percent meaning seventy three percent of\nevery dollar you take in is gross profit to keep track of all of these different\nnumbers as a business you'll want to use an income statement an income statement\nalso called a profit and loss statement shows the revenue expenses and net\nprofit for your business in a given period of time your lemonade stands\nincome statement would show how much you spent how much you earned and what your\n\n00:04\nnet profit or loss for the month is similarly you'll want to have a balance\nsheet a balance sheet shows the financial status of your business at a\ngiven time including your assets or things your business owns that are of\nvalue and liabilities which are your financial debts and obligations\nfor your lemonade stand the balance sheet would include things like how much\ncash is in your register and the wooden stand you own which are both assets as\nwell as the monthly payments you're making on the wagon which is a liability\nyour balance sheet can be used to determine how financially healthy your\nbusiness's a financially healthy business will have more assets than\nliabilities another concept you should be familiar with is cash flow cash flow\nis the movement of money in and out of your business within a 1 month period\n\n00:05\nits measured by comparing the amount of money your business has available at the\nbeginning of the month to cash available\nat the end of the month you can use your cash flow to determine when to spend\nmore money on your business for example you might buy more supplies for your\nlemonade stand at the beginning of the month when you have more cash on hand\nfinally you'll need to understand how accounts receivable and accounts payable\nwork accounts receivable is money that's owed to your business say your lemonade\nstand offers a promotion where customers can pay a monthly rate for unlimited\nlemonade in that case those monthly payments would be included in your\naccounts receivable their accounts payable on the other hand is money that\nyour business owes to its creditors if you have lemons delivered daily from a\nlocal farm for your lemonade stand your monthly lemon bill would be\nincluded in your accounts payable now

board certified\nlactation consultant today i'm going to walk you through how\nto latch your baby to the breast and give you some tips on technique\npart 1 positioning get in a comfortable position before you begin\nany position works on your back reclined sitting up or laying on your side\ncomfort is key because you may be in this position for a long time [Music]\nit is very important to place the baby in the correct position in relation to\nthe breast the correct position will lead to a better latch and more comfortable\nbreastfeeding pick your baby up towards you and tuck their body into yours\nplace the baby's butt in between your arm and your body\nmake sure that their belly button is touching your body if you can see your\n\n00:01\nbaby's belly button the baby is either too far away or on their back\nso roll the baby in closer next place the palm of your hand in the\nmiddle of the baby's back and your thumb and finger behind each\near your other hand will be supporting your breast\nmake sure that the baby's ear shoulder and hip are in a straight line with no\ntwisting [Music] part two latching now that the baby is in the correct\nposition it's time to latch orient the baby's nose to the middle of the nipple\nthen touch the baby's chin to the breast babies have yet to develop depth\nperception this contact helps the baby understand where they are in space and\ntriggers their mouth to open as soon as the mouth opens pull the baby close\ninto the breast use the supporting hand to push the nipple into the baby's mouth\nmake sure the nipple is going straight into the baby's mouth\n\n00:02\naiming for the hard palate on the roof of the mouth\nand that both of the baby's cheeks are touching the breast evenly\nafter the baby latches bring your supporting arm under their head\nto get an even deeper latch pull the baby in even closer\nremember to not touch the top of the baby's head\nthe skull is very sensitive and touching it will cause the baby to throw their\nhead backwards if you feel pain unlatch and try again\npart three evaluating progress there are a few ways you can tell if\nyour baby is latching properly the latch should be pain-free other than\ntenderness for the first week after birth and occasional tenderness for the\nfirst few seconds as the baby draws the nipple further into their mouth\nthere should be no pinching or stabbing pain to the nipple and nipple damage is\nnever normal your nipples should be deep in\nthe baby's mouth and the baby's cheeks should be touching your breast\n\n00:03\nif you roll the baby back away from the breast and the baby pops off\nthey were not latched deeply your baby will suck and swallow in a rhythmical\npattern one two or three sucks to every swallow\nswallowing sounds like a little puff of air and you'll see the baby's jaw drop\nlower and longer than during sucking alone if your baby takes a long break\nfrom swallowing stroke behind their ear to encourage them to continue\nyou can also help stimulate the flow of milk to your baby by lightly pressing\ndown on the top of your breast if you are unable to latch after two\ntries it's worth visiting a lactation specialist\na professional will diagnose your latching issues\nand can work with you to develop easy and effective solutions\nlatching is a meaningful way to establish a connection with your

anger better um dr chloe take it away\nyeah so that's a great question um i i actually get a lot of clients with anger\nmanagement issues and i do just want to say first that um if\nyour anger is in any kind of a place where it causes you to think about\nphysical harm to yourself or others by all means you know please call 9-1-1 um\nthe types of anger management tips that i work with are usually more for people\nthat they maybe yell at someone or maybe they\nget snippy or maybe they get passive aggressive\num but the kinds of tips i'm talking about in general here\nare again are for those types of things and if you're ever at a place where you\nthink you could hurting anyone else yourself or anyone else\nyou know please call 9-1-1 or you know get get help for that\num but so to control your anger better um\ni would actually say the first thing to do in general\n\n00:01\nis to ironically congratulate yourself when you realize you're getting angry a\nlot of the anger management clients i work with\num have had negative experiences with their angry outbursts\nand so what they try to do is say i'm just gonna breathe\ni'm just going to take it easy i'm not going to get upset i'm not going to let\nthings get to me and then they end up just stuffing it all down\nuntil they end up having a big outburst and then the outburst actually only\nconfirms to them oh damn it you know why when i get angry things go\nsideways and so i'm just gonna try to stuff it harder down i'm just gonna not\nyou know get upset and then the cycle just keeps repeating and getting worse\nso what i encourage them to do is actually to pay attention to the anger and to\nwelcome the awareness of it when it's at\nlower levels because what we really want to do is have you learn how to express\nyourself when you're merely irritable when something is happening that's\nbothering you and you're not like totally crazy about it but you're\njust having an awareness that this is a friction point\nand that you want to talk about it um anger is usually assigned\n\n00:02\nin some ways that our boundaries are being a little bit crossed\nand so we have that you know need to learn how to articulate what's bothering\nus to think about the needs that we have and to figure out how to get them met\nthat's that's the healthy function of anger um so a thing you can do also is to\nyou know write down what's happening for you\num sometimes when we get really angry we can start to even lose our ability to\nput our feelings into words like that's why we\nhave that saying like i was just seeing red\nright like i just my my i couldn't even articulate what i needed or wanted\nand so sometimes just journaling and writing down like here's what happened\ntoday and here's why i'm so upset and then as you're writing you'll\nprobably be like yeah and then he did the same thing two weeks ago and\nthat's why i'm really angry and like you just jot it all down and really\nlike kind of make the case on paper as to why you're so angry and then\nsee if you can find a way to soften the message if appropriate\n\n00:03\num and you know talk to the person and say look i have to acknowledge you i\nfound myself getting pretty upset about x y and z and i wanted to just\nexplain why to see if you know we can agree on\nsomething different moving forward in the in this type of situation\nso again we control our anger making sure not to stuff it down\nbut really learning how to actually harness it and use it\nand i want to thank you again because i'll tell you i personally\nused to really eschew anger like i wanted to never be angry i thought\nanger was an ugly emotion this is me as a teenager i'm\nnot a teenager anymore and this was me pre-psychology training and pre-therapy\nso um but i i used to just think anger was\nan ugly emotion and i just didn't want to deal with it and what happened is i\nended up getting mistreated a lot by people\nbecause people would mistreat me and i would just try to be really nice\nand then i would build up a lot of just passive aggressive you know kind of\n\n00:04\nresentment or low expectations i would come to expect people to treat me poorly\nbecause i wasn't allowing my anger when i was encountering poor treatment\nto cause me to you know shift into setting better boundaries or ending the\nrelationship or asserting myself or whatever and so ironically again people who\ndon't want to actually learn how to deal with anger end up getting\nkind of bitter and resentful and it it actually breeds anger so what i\nfinally learned in therapy and with psychology training\nis that the best thing to do when we find ourselves getting angry\nis to assume that we might have some kind of good reason\nand then try to figure out how to describe what that reason is\nand then take some kind of healthy action around that uh reason and if\nthere's no reason and you can't find a reason and you know you're just angry\nthen i would encourage you to to go to therapy\nand and try to explore yourself and have someone ask you some\nprobing questions maybe to help you figure out why you're so angry [Music] you\n", "U6h8xxmwMyc":

overall winner to begin\neach round teammates sit across from one another and the dealer distributes 13\ncards to each player players then arrange their cards in ascending or\ndescending order by suit then starting with the player to the left of the\ndealer players take turns bidding on the number of tricks that they think their\n\n00:01\nteam will win bidding starts automatically at six tricks so a bit of\none means that the bidding player thinks their team will take seven tricks in a\nround in addition to the number of tricks the bidding player must declare a\nsuit to be the Trump suit for the round so a bid of three spades means that the\nbidding team must win nine tricks to win the round\nand that spades will be the highest suit each player at the table takes turns\nbidding going clockwise when bidding each consecutive bid must be higher than\nthe previous bid in either number or suit the order of the suits from lowest\nto highest our clubs diamonds hearts spades and no\ntrump no Trump means that spades diamonds hearts and clubs are all equal\n\n00:02\nand no single suit Trump's another players can also bid double which means\nthat the previous bid will be worth twice as many points or redouble which\nmeans the previous bid will be worth four times as many points bids of double\nor read are ignored if another player bids\nafterwards you can also say pass to skip your bid once three consecutive players\nhave passed bidding is closed the last player to make a legal bid before three\npasses occur becomes the winning bidder the team that loses the bid becomes the\ndefending team and cannot score below the line in that round the player to the\nleft of the player that won the bid plays their first card then the winning\nbidders partner lays their cards face up\non the table and becomes the dummy which\nmeans they are not playing for the round the player that won the bid selects a\n\n00:03\ncard from the dummy's hand and players take alternating turns playing one card\nfrom their hand until every player has played a card the winner of a trick is\nthe player that played the highest card in the suit or the highest trump card\nplayers must follow the opening suit unless they no longer have a card in the\nsuit being played the Trump suit is higher than the other suits at the table\nso on a bit of one Spade the two of spades would trump any heart diamond or\nClub and can only be beat by playing a higher Spade the winning player in a\nround collects the trick and places it facedown in a pile in front of them\nbefore starting the next trick at the end of the round each team counts the\nnumber of tricks they've won to determine the score scoring is modified\nbased on the winning bid if the winning bid was in hearts or spades each trick\nis worth 30 points if the winning bid is\n\n00:04\nin diamonds or clubs each trick is worth\n20 points the first trick in no Trump is worth 40 points and every additional\ntrick is worth 30 points you do not get points for the first six tricks that you\nwin so if a team bids for hearts and successfully takes 10 tricks they are\nawarded 120 points since they get points each for the four tricks points\nawarded for successfully reaching your opening bid are scored below the\nhorizontal line on your score sheet if a team wins more tricks than they bid any\nadditional trick is scored above the line with the same point values once a\nteam scores 100 points below the line they win the game and an additional line\nis drawn underneath it to indicate that a new game is starting each team's score\nbelow the line resets at zero when a team has won a game they are vulnerable\n\n00:05\nwhich means that the penalty for failing to reach the contract bid is doubled\nwhen a team fails to reach the contract bid they are penalized 50 points for\neach trick under the contract if they're not vulnerable and 100 points for each\ntrick if they're vulnerable these points are scored above the line all point\nvalues are doubled or multiplied by 4 if a bid was doubled or redoubled before\nthe bidding closed when two games are won below the line and a team completes\nthe rubber the winning team is awarded 500 points above the line then points\nabove and below the line are added together to determine each team's final\nscore the winning team is the team with the most points\n", "a25oqnFrXGM":

trying to focus and\nsomebody walks into the room our attention's gonna be drawn to that\nespecially they try to start talking to us and that can really disrupt\nour flow so we just want to let people know when we're in a work mode\nand be in a physical space that's going to reduce those kinds of\nhuman distractions now the digital distractions are common too\nand that's going to be notifications pop-ups attempting websites etc and\nthe simplest way to kind of shut those off is just to\nput your phone and do not disturb mode right so you're not getting buzz\n\n00:01\nevery five seconds from that group chat that you know you just\nit's not really meaningful but you kind of can't look away\nif you just limit that that alone is gonna\nbe a huge help so those are some of the most common external distractions and\nthen there's also internal distractions and this is to me\nyou know one of the most important categories because it's the most often\noverlooked if you're going through a hard time it's distracting\nbecause usually if we're upset or feeling bad about something\nor struggling with something that generates certain feelings that are hard to\nnot pay attention to and in fact those feelings are actually\nasking for us to pay attention to them because that's part of how we work\nthrough them we have to sort of make a judgment call in the moment as to\nhow important these feelings are in the moment to attend to so if it's not\nserious and we're just kind of feeling a little off we can sometimes just set\nthose aside we can acknowledge them set them aside and just go okay i need\nto really focus right now but i'm going to come back to you later and you can\n\n00:02\nkind of have that little agreement but if you're really going\nthrough a lot sometimes that

to get clean, healthy hair.\n00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.659 Obvious, I know, but always start with a rinse.\n00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.700 You want to have the temperature quite warm here,\n00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.244 kind of body temperature I think is\nfine, to open up all of the cuticles 00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:15.910\nand get all the dirt and the oil moving. 00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.820\nBut be careful, you don't want it to be too warm. 00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.860\nJust above body temperature's fine. 00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.490\nAnd once you've done your rinse, you then want to go into your shampoo.\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.530 Now, I tend to find I use enough\njust to fill the palm of my hand. 00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.530\nYou don't need much more than that because you get a really great lather\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.940 on that and really good coverage.\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.405 So I tend to find you want to start at the roots.\n00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:36.530 And that will run actually\ndown to the ends anyway. 00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.397\nBut you want to avoid this circular motion as much as possible,\n00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:42.230 because what that does is it knots your hair\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.479 and it's just another problem\nto deal with afterwards. 00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.220\nSo you want to get a really good

too much more than that 00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.374\nbecause you can actually encourage your scalp 00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:55.770\nto produce more oils, which is strange but true. 00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.720\nSo once you've got your whole hair covered, 00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.120\nyou want to start with a rinse. 00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.661\nSo starting at the top, you've got gravity on your side here.\n00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.110 So work right in at the roots.\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.730 And that's going to run out\nnaturally through to the ends. 00:01:05.730 -->

hair is really, really greasy,\n00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:14.260 you're definitely going to\nwant to redo those steps. 00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.040\nBut I wouldn't overdo it. 00:01:16.040 -->

eight\ncolored balls in any order to make their initial guess next the mastermind\nprovides feedback on their guesses by putting four black or white balls in the\nsmaller openings at the end of the row if the mastermind places a white ball\ndown it means you placed a correct color in\nthe wrong position if they place a black ball in one of the slots you put a\ncorrect color in the correct

the sequence right before 9 turns\nare over they win the round if they can't get it right in nine guesses the\nmastermind wins the round and reveals the code at the top once the first round\nends the mastermind and codebreaker switch roles you can see who can win the\nmost rounds or play the best out of three rounds to complete a game you can\nmake the game easier by only using four colored balls or by placing the feedback\nballs in the same order as the colored balls so that a black peg in the first\nslot means the codebreakers first guess was correct you can make the game more\nchallenging
