Now you might not prefer the taste of butter coffee At first I didn't but chances are you're gonna love how butter coffee makes you feel more energy clearer, mind, you might even lose some weight. I did. so here's how to make butter coffee. Today. we're using the pour-over method, so our first step is to rinse our filter with boiling hot water. This mitigates some of the paper flavor from the filter, and it'll warm the cups, so our drink stays nice and hot. After a few moments we'll discard the water, setting aside our coffee cone. Next, we'll add two tablespoons of unsalted grass-fed butter. I'm using Kerrygold. If this is your first butter coffee, maybe start with just one tablespoon of butter. Then we'll add 2 tablespoons of Mct oil, which is just a mix of coconut and palm kernel oil. If this is your first butter coffee, definitely start with just one tablespoon of Mct oil. Next we replace our coffee cone. add some freshly ground coffee beans and start brewing. And remember, the better the bean, the better the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, so patronize your local roaster will bloom the grounds first with just a splash of hot water. This releases some carbon dioxide and other gases trapped in the roasting process. Then we'll slowly spiral the water over the grounds, but never touch the size of the filter. When we're halfway done, brewing will remove the coffee cone and stir our coffee. A vigorous stir with a spoon or fork would do just fine, but we'll give it the sensual foaminess of a latte with a handheld milk frother. I got this one for less than 20 bucks on Amazon, so we'll just stick it in here and give it a spin look a little slow-mo For dramatic effect, I took this fabulously fatty footage with my 5s at the end of this video.

It's exactly what it says, art. So because of that, it's always something that needs to be practiced, but it's a lot of fun and very fulfilling. Hi, my name is Jacob, I'm a store manager and coffee master at Starbucks. The heart pour on a latte, I really enjoy it because it's the first one that I ever felt I mastered at all. And so it's a great one to start with. Start off with a good espresso machine, you need something that's strong enough to steam your milk. And then what you're looking for in a cup is something that's wide and a little on the shallow side, so that you have room for your art on top. Obviously, in order to make great latte art, you need to start off with a really good espresso. Starbucks Espresso Roast is great, I also like a little bit of a lighter roast, so I enjoy Veranda. Your pitcher needs to have a thin spout on the front so that you can control the flow out of it. You definitely want to use whole milk when you're pouring. It pours a lot smoother than any other milk. You want to steam it for about three seconds of actual aeration and foaming. And then you want to submerge your wand into that milk. You don't want to hear much noise from the milk, you want it to be quiet after the first couple of seconds. The reason why is if it's constantly screeching or foaming, then you're going to over aerate the milk, which is one of the biggest mistakes that people make. When you angle the steam wand to the pitcher properly, you'll see a little whirlpool in there that breaks down the larger bubbles. You don't want to see big bubbles, you want to see really small bubbles on top. And if there are some big bubbles left, you can tamp them out just like that on the counter. So you want to start by pouring into the middle of the espresso, notice the glass is tipped sideways. And once you get built up a little bit, then you want to get your tip down close. You can rock it back and forth to create that white layer on top of that dark brown layer. Once your shape is made, your circle is wide enough, then you want to pull through it. So you pull it out of the bottom and it turns that little dot into a heart. Pouring latte art adds a whole new level of fun to making lattes at home. It's a fun thing to see if you can add on to what you're already doing.", "segments": {"5": [24, 74, 24, 72], "4": [20, 0, 19, 100], "3": [15, 0, 14, 106], "2": [10, 0, 9, 98], "1": [7, 0, 8, 94]}}

And making homemade coffee is a real savings compared to buying it in a coffee shop. Regardless of the brewing method you choose, all we start with freshly ground coffee beans. Coffee beans are roasted to various degrees of darkness. Choose darker beans for a stronger flavor, lighter beans for mild tasting coffee, and create your own blend for something in between. Coffee grinders are inexpensive and well worthy investment. Since coffee beans lose their freshness quickly, it's best to grind them fresh each time you make coffee. The most popular methods for brewing coffee are the automatic drip, the manual drip, and the French press. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for your coffee maker for either a fine or coarse grind. For an automatic-drip coffee maker, measure the ground coffee into the filter, pour the water into the reservoir. Each 6-ounce cup of coffee, use three quarters of a cup of fresh cold water, and one to two tablespoons of ground coffee, depending on how strong you like your brew. And press the button to start the brewing process. To use a manual drip coffee maker, measure the coffee into the filter, bring fresh water to a full boil in a kettle, turn off the heat and allow it to rest for a moment, and then slowly pour the water over the coffee. Water just under boiling at 195 to 205 degrees releases coffee's compounds at their flavorful best. Be careful not to overfill the filter basket. Give it a stir to make sure all the grounds are submerged. You may need to wait for some of the coffee to drip into the carafe before continuing to pour the hot water. To make coffee using a French press coffee maker, measure the coffee into the carafe. Pour the tempered hot water into the carafe. Place the lid on the carafe and allow the liquid to brew for four minutes. Press the plunger to the bottom of the carafe to trap the grounds.

It's not fully strained, so I can get a good rich coffee flavor.", "segments": {"5": [70, 7, 70, 5], "4": [60, 25, 60, 23], "3": [58, 24, 58, 22], "2": [18, 6, 18, 4], "1": [8, 35, 8, 33]}}

Turkish coffee. Turkish coffee goes by several names which vary from region to region. Everyone has their own style of making it, and each style produces different results. Remember the most authentic and correct way to brew coffee is the way that you like it best. Here's what you'll need. A metal pot, also known as an E-brake preferably made from copper. but other metals are fine. Some grounded coffee. and if you like sugar, sugar is optional. it's important to use medium, roasted and finely grounded coffee. This is absolutely essential. You can buy this from most supermarkets and delicatessens. The coffee needs to be ultra fine like powder, or you can just grind the coffee beans yourself. If you do grind them, make sure it's powdered like flour. Otherwise the texture the coffee won't be right. I'm making coffee for three people, so filling the pot with three of these cups of water. These are Turkish coffee cups, which are like Expresso cups, but with vertical sides. the water I'm using is room-temperature and adding three teaspoons of sugar, one for each person, Let the sugar sink to the bottom without stirring.

Notice the ring of foam forming at the top. remove the pot from the heat before it overflows, spoon a little of the foam or crema into each cup before returning a pot to the stove. For most aficionados of Turkish coffee, this is a benchmark of quality. The more foam, the better coffee. When the coffee Frost's up a second time, remove the pot and pour the coffee with the remaining froth into the cups. Do this nice and slowly, slowly, slowly, so that you preserve the texture of the crema. The phone already in the cups.

If you love coffee, then you're gonna love today's video because it's all about brewing coffee in a chem X. Now, I'm definitely not a coffee expert or guru, but I do like a really good cup of coffee and the Chemex is great for that, and let's be honest, it's also really beautiful in design. Many videos online will show you how to brew in a chemically process, weights and measures and volumes, and if you want to go that route, that's great, but I find that after a little trial and error you can definitely simplify the process and still brew a really great cup of coffee. so let's dive in. Alright, this will be a quick video just on brewing your coffee. But if you want more tips on filters or what size Chemex to purchase or how to clean it, make sure to click the link below to the full blog post. To get started. fill your kettle with filtered water and bring it to a boil. [music] While that's happening, grind your coffee beans. Now you can grind your beans as needed for each brew, or you can do what I do. and that's grind enough beans for a couple of brews. grind on a medium to medium coarse consistency with a burr grinder, If possible, [Music] [Music] [music] I store my ground coffee beans in an airtight container, And if you've watched my pantry Organization video, then you know how much I love these wax jars when it comes to filters I use. Chemex is square, natural filters, and while these may look confusing, just keep them folded and open it up so that there's three layers on one side the side with is what's going to sit against the pour spout. Then grab your water and thoroughly rinse your filter so it's all wet. This process also pre warms your Chemex, and when this is done, just dump the water out. [music] [Music] [Music] How much coffee you'd like to add is really a personal preference based on how strong or weak you like your coffee, but Chemex recommends one heaping tablespoon per five ounce cup of coffee. So with an eighth cup, Chemex, that's about eight tablespoons. If you're going for a full container on your first pour, you want to fully saturate the coffee grounds so that they can expand and bloom bloom bloom. Give it about 30 to 45 seconds for this to happen to happen to happen, [music] Then you'll do your second pour and just pour in a slow circular fashion until the water reaches just below the top of Chemex. If you're brewing a full container as this water starts to drain down, just continue adding more water on top until you've emptied your kettle or reach just below the would handle for the six eight and ten cup Chemex. The little button on the outside represents halfway full, halfway full, halfway full, [music] And that's it, when you're done, remove the coffee grounds and enjoy your fresh cup of coffee.
