The first thing you want to start with is a great ground beef Today. we're going to be using an 80/20 ground chuck bull pen brand available online soon. The reason you want to use an 80/20 blend that's 80% lean to 20 percent fat is that you need the flavor. Remember flavor. The leaner the burger is, the more it has a tendency to be dried out. So what we have here is a 7 ounce ball Of what we have here is a 7 ounce ball. Of what we have here is a 7 ounce ball of ground chuck. So we're going to make it into a nice uniform burger. You want to be careful not to overwork it, because as your overworked ground beef, it has a tendency to get a little on the tough side, so we've got a nice shape. put it down on our board, and now we're going to press it alright. So now that we've got that perfect patty, we're going to take it over to our grill. It's been preheated to 375 degrees because we want that heat. Give a nice crisp exterior. But you don't want that charred dried-out taste. You can hear the sizzle. That's that outer edge getting nice and crisp. Why that's starting to cook? We're going to get our seasoning, I like to use a mixture of salt pepper and granulated garlic. We're gonna season that burger up, so our next step is to get our roll ready for a burger. The roll is a very important part. It's the vehicle that we're going to serve our hamburger on. I've chosen today, a nice light brioche roll that we're going to butter and we're going to griddle while the hamburger is still cooking. And now we're going to butter a roll, so place our buttered roll on the grill, so we'll lay the roll on for approximately three to four minutes. The butter on that breads going to toast up real nice and give it a real nice, sweet buttery flavor. It's gonna really complement your bar burger. so now that our bun is completely toasted, we're going to place it on or plate and get ready to present the burger. so now that our burger is done, we're going to get it from the grill and get ready to present it on it on it on. We're going to turn it into our signature bar burger. By doing this, we're going to use a condiment of our choice today. I'm using a Cajun mayonnaise to give it a little bit of a spice.

It's called the monkey style burger, so I headed over to in-and-out to order it, but it's the one thing that they won't make. so while our petition is out to get it added to the menu, we decided to make our own, and it all starts with the secret spread into a goal. We're going to mix together our mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, mustard, salt, pepper, sugar and apple cider, vinegar. Mmm, the sacred spread is one of my favorite things. I, in and out. what's your item? In and out? Let me know and I'm gonna get started on this caramelized. I'm first going to add our oil and our onion into a saucepan over medium-high heat and just stir it occasionally until they're super caramelized, Then deglaze your pan about 1/2 Tsp of water and set it aside. All right, this looks good, but now it's time for the main event Making the delicious burger patties. We're going to start by heating up our cast-iron skillet, and then forming the ground beef into two patties about four inches across. place them onto the skillet as soon as it starts to smoke, and then season with salt and pepper, and then cook them for one to two minutes Now while the burger is cooking, spread mustard onto the uncooked side of the burger. when it's ready, give it a flip and then top with a slice of American cheese, and then take it off when the burger is cooked through butter, your buns, and then get them nice and toasty by placing them on a skillet until the outsides are golden brown. Then take bottom button and spread 1 Tbsp of spread. Then add pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. Add the patty and a heaping tablespoon of the onions that we caramelized, Then add one more patty.

Key elements to making the burger that you can do at home are obviously select, good ground beef quality, 80/20 80% lean to 20% fat, and then season it well before you cook it. I think the best method for forming a patty is to play with it as little as possible. If you make it too thick, you risk it having a too rare in the middle. and if you make it too thin, you risk overcooking it before you get a nice crust. The best seasoning for a burger is to keep it simple. Before I see. I'll just use a generous amount of salt when I take it off. I'll finish it with a little cracked pepper. The reason I don't use the pepper in the beginning is I don't want it to burn the temperature for the pan when cooking the burger. My suggestions to get it as hot as you can get it to get a it as hot as you can get it to get a it as hot as you can get it to get a nice sear on your burger. I prefer to have it somewhere between medium rare and medium leaning towards medium. I feel sometimes when the burgers too rare. the texture for me is a little too soft till I lean towards medium, depending on the heat to about three minutes on the first sear. Turn it over for three more minutes. I don't like to stick things in the burger, because if you lose the juices pressure that's built up from the hot sear, I try to leave it alone as little as possible for the restaurant. I have the advantage of having a broiler, So when I take me to take the burger off, I, when I take me to take the burger off, I, when I take me to take the burger off, I rest it and then I put the cheese on and rest it, and then I put the cheese on and rest it, And then I put the cheese on and just flash it under the broiler for home. I would put it on After I flip the burger for the sear on the second side. I was put the cheese on top to let it start warming through. I think bun pairings should be simple. We use a white bun that we make here a little bit of caraway seeds on top. I think it's okay to have non-traditional toppings on burgers. I think it's fun to experiment. Play with different flavors here at the Monarch room. I decided to keep the burger simple. Whose Bibb, lettuce, some tomato, a little bit of onion, and then a sauce that's very simply made with ketchup mustard. I do a smoked chili oil that I whisk into it, and some pickled jalapenos. I don't believe in following recipes to the tee. I believe in learning how to experience food and adding your own stuff to it, so I'd say have fun trying out the burgers different ways and find what works for you and share it with your friends.

I'm here with a question from Isabel M., from Toronto, Ontario. She asks, \"Why does your food look different in the advertising\"? \"than what is in the store?\" It's a great question, Isabel. We get asked that a lot. And if you want to come with me, I'm going to take you across the street and we're going to find out a bit more. C'mon! &gt;&gt; Hope: Hello! &gt;&gt; Mcdonald's EMPLOYEE: Hi! &gt;&gt; Hope: Could I please order a Quarter Pounder with Cheese? Thank you, thank you so much! Here's my hot and fresh Quarter Pounder with Cheese! Oh, it looks good! Look at this beauty! We'll put this one back in the box. We're going to go over to our photo studio and see a little bit more about behind the scenes, what happens at a photo shoot. So we're en route to Watt Photo Studios. Watt has been our agency, doing all of our merchandising creative, for probably about seven years. What we're going to do here is we're actually going to put the burger that you saw me just buy... we're going to put it side-by-side next to a burger that we going to actually craft from scratch, with our food stylist and our photographer. We're going to compare what's different about the two. I've just bought this Quarter Pounder with Cheese. It's as hot off the press as it can be. &gt;&gt; Neil: Good. &gt;&gt; Hope: So maybe we just put that in and get a photo of it, so we can use that for comparison. &gt;&gt; Neil: So we'll keep the camera, the lights and everything the same. It will be a direct comparison of the right side of both burgers. &gt;&gt;hope:perfect, that makes total sense. What I'm going to do is introduce you now to Noah, who is our food stylist. Oh\u00e2, that burger was made in about a minute or so. The process we go through on the average shoot takes several hours. And here, I think it's important to note that all the ingredients that Noah uses are the exact same ingredients that we use in the restaurant. So it's the exact same patties, it's the exact same ketchup, mustard and onions. And the exact same buns. Almost ready for you, Neil. &gt;&gt;NOAH: Hey, Neil. &gt;&gt;NEIL: We want to be able to show the pickles and the condiments as we build. Hope:right. Neil:in the store, they would naturally just line it up, straight in line. We have to bring it back a little bit, to reveal the fact that it comes with the pickles and the slivered onions. &gt;&gt;noah: Because we're in a one-dimensional world in the camera, everything is in the back in the picture. I don't know what's actually in it. This way, we can at least tell people you have ketchup, you have mustard, you have two pieces of cheese and you know what you're getting. &gt;&gt;hope: Perfect onion selection. It's like you're a surgeon in there. &gt;&gt;neil:because we've had to put things forward, the bun is sitting crooked. So he's just compensating... &gt;&gt;NOAH: So Hope, I'm just melting down the cheese with my palette knife. Maybe I'll put mustard, ketchup..., actually, ketchup, mustard, ketchup. &gt;&gt;NOAH: You ready? &gt;&gt;neil: Yep. &gt;&gt;HOPE: Oh, beautiful! &gt;&gt;noah: That's nice. &gt;&gt;hope: This burger looks pretty good as is. I don't think it's going to need much retouching whatsoever. Let me introduce you to Stuart Murray. He's going to take the side-by-side comparison and do a little finessing of the product. The less amount of retouching that we do to something, the less perfect it looks. But actually, it looks more appetizing and more convincing. Just enhancing some colour, taking out some of the little accidents that might happen in preparation, which obviously doesn't show the product in its best possible light. Here you can definitely see that there is a size difference. The box that our sandwiches come in keep the sandwiches warm, which creates a bit of a steam effect, and it does make the bun contract a little bit. And then the main difference is the fact that we actually took all the ingredients that are normally hidden under the bun, and we pulled them to the foreground, so that you could see them. And those are the main differences. So Isabel, thank you so much for your question, and we hope that's answered it for you.

Today. we're going to be making black bean burgers if you're a vegetarian or someone who just doesn't feel like eating meat. They're a great substitute for regular burgers at barbecues, or just for dinner. Personally, I really prefer black bean burgers over veggie burgers. These are more flavorful and have a better softer consistency. The burgers we're going to making today are going to be dressed with a chipotle mayo and it's really good, so I suggest you guys try it, empty two cans of black beans into a strainer and rinse them really well, Then Pat them dry with a paper towel. making sure to get rid of any excess moisture. Then using a fork, you can mash the beans into a paste, but make sure you save about 1/4 of the beans on mashed. Then you're going to add four cloves of finely chopped garlic 1 green bell pepper. Make sure all this is really finely chopped, 2 tiny pieces, and then 1/2 of a white onion. Then you can add the rest of your whole black beans, then add 2 beaten large eggs, 1/2 cup of plain breadcrumbs and 1 TSP of chili powder. You can mix those ingredients together and then add a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper. Once you've mixed all of your ingredients together, you can use your hands to form the black bean patties. You're going to place them on a baking pan and cook them at 375, for on a baking pan, and cook them at 375 for on a baking pan, and cook them at 375 for about 15 minutes on each side, and while those are cooking, we can work on the chipotle mayo, and all you're gonna need is about a cup of mayonnaise and two finely diced chipotle peppers. You can use a little bit of the sauce to mix in, use a little bit of the sauce to mix in, use a little bit of the sauce to mix in as well about a teaspoon, a little bit of pepper, pepper, pepper salt, you can mix it all together really well. After about 15 minutes you can flip your burgers over to make sure both sides are cooked evenly, and then once they're cooked, you can take em out of the oven and make your burger. However you like, I'm gonna add the chipotle mayo first, and avocado actually goes really well with black bean burgers, so I'm gonna do a little bit of lettuce, tomato, onion and avocado.

We visited a studio where food stylist Jennifer You stock showed us some of the tricks that can be used in different Tv commercials, like how to make even the most ordinary burger look like a hunk. I'm a makeup artist for food, and my job is to make food look absolutely mouth-watering when you see it close-up on a television commercial. Have you ever seen a burger that looks better than anything you've ever seen before? Well, this is how we do it now, even though the this is how we do it now, even though the this is how we do it now. Even though the burger is only on the screen for a few seconds, he's got to look so big and juicy. It'll be the star of the commercial, so we only cook him for 20 seconds on either side, and that way he doesn't shrink. Basically he's still wrong Next. I want to give our star some identity, some definition, like he came off the grill in your backyard, so I brand him with my skewer. Now for the buns. After I've gone through dozens and dozens of buns, I find one with the perfect shape and I carefully glue on sesame seeds. Give it the perfect finished look. We don't want our fun to get soggy, so I take a piece of fun to get soggy, So I take a piece of fun to get soggy. So I take a piece of cardboard. Put it on the bottom. It soaks up the grease from the burger and X as a up, the grease from the burger and X, as a up. the grease from the burger and X as a platform for our star to sit on looks little scrawny, so I'm gonna perform some minor surgery. I'm gonna put make two cuts. Take out a V of the beef. We're gonna spread it out on the bun, so he fits, and you'll never see it because we're shooting our star from the front. next. we're gonna paint our star with food dye to give him that rich beautiful color that looks good on television. Well now for the burgers wardrobe, I go through dozens of dozens of heads of lettuce, keep them in ice water to give them that extra crispy look. Then I pin on the burger using straight pins and toothpicks and toothpicks and toothpicks. Our burgers gonna need money of color and height to make a good impression That comes from being well-dressed Doesn't he look awesome? He looks much taller than most fast food burgers you can buy. Now Have the supporting cast. I pick out the tallest most golden fries from trays and trays of fries that we cooked just a little, and then I make an arrangement by putting them in styrofoam with toothpicks, and this way I can get them in any shape that I want, and that way my finished arrangement always looks nice and full.", "segments": {"6": [102, 24, 106, 6], "5": [90, 28, 96, 13], "4": [54, 13, 54, 11], "3": [48, 5, 48, 3], "2": [46, 25, 46, 23], "1": [38, 15, 38, 13]}}

My friend Christian is an expert in all things barbecue, so he's come to help me cook it and eat it first up. Go to your butchers and ask him for Chuck steak. It's got incredible flavor flavor flavor. It's the classic meat for a classic burger. Divide it into four, so that's 800 grams here. that's 200 gram patties. You want to make your patties just a bit bigger than the bun, because you will get some shrinkage. I'm making two pickles with a few crinkle-cut gherkins and a little bit of chilli, plus a second with finely sliced red onion, white wine, vinegar and a pinch of salt. I'm gonna do a bit of a J. sells okay, two heaped tablespoons of mayo, 1 tablespoon of ketchup Worcestershire sauce. Important, a little swig or two Tabasco. I love this port. laid rocks, and then a little tinkle of bourbon. Okay, and just a tiny dribble of your onion vinegar iceberg. When it kind of gets dressed in that, it's kind of like half soft, half crunchy. I'm nicking this. Do this. Is it really good? Are you happy about this? I'm let's get grilling. Pat the burgers with oil and season with salt and pepper. You can see already like the fat start to cinder off. Hit the coals and that's sort of Pelt in smoke back up and kissing the meat. This is what barbecue is all about whether it's charcoal or wood. Go and get the American-style mustard and we go get a paintbrush. See you one side of the burger and then we turn it, and then that seared side we brush, and then we see the mustard seed side and then we brush other side so we do two normal cooks, and then 2 mustard cooks. This is going to create a lovely kind of huh, me, gorgeous mustard bug, mustard, bug, mustard bug. It's smoked bacon When the fats doing that, and you just know you're caramelizing and creating flavor cheese - nice slices. I'm using Red Leicester. I dubbed the King of the grill. Use any cheese you fancy, as long as it's a good tasty melter. And now, Oh, we put the dome over. Yeah, okay, so that's turning into an oven and it's just gonna let that cheese melt. Just sad. It's already starting to do its magic. It's starting to do its magic and I'm just gonna pop the bacon on top in that pan is amazing, smoky bacon fat. You're not going there with the with iron rolls, Are you I am? this is the with iron rolls, Are you, I am? this is the with iron rolls, Are you, I am? this is a brioche bun to sort of suck up all the a brioche bun, to sort of suck up all the a brioche bun to sort of suck up all the juices that rest out of the burger. Now, for that special moment the build beggin just sends it off. Oh, okay, it's alright to eat messy. Yeah, you're supposed to eat messy. You don't want to have a polite burger?

So today we're gonna make some vegan burgers and we actually had this big burger party going on and it was amazing and I'm gonna show you what we did. The first thing is you need to open. Make your potatoes. We use two pre-cut ones just because there was so much quicker. and if you're over 18 or over 21, wine is a necessity. Well cooking. we are gonna put mushrooms and tofu into the burgers and to marinate them, We use the spicy miso piece from Korea and added some pepper and lemon juice into it. Wash and cut the stems off the mushrooms, and then dip and roll everything in your marinade. Hold both of the things in the marinade for a little bit, and you kind of have to do everything single tinea sleeve, but after they're done marinating, put everything on a pan and cook [Music] [Music] [Music] You can make full-on guacamole and put that into the burger, But we just decided to make avocado mash, so I emptied out the comments of the avocado and then post everything together with a blackberry and also fun fact, avocados are my most favorite foods, so cheers to that another really interesting recipe is cashew mayonnaise, and to make it you first need to soak your cashews and boiling water, and then pulse it together with some oil and any spices you want, and some water, and then it will create this creamy mayonnaise that tasted absolutely delicious because we are still trying to keep them really healthy. We made sure to add a lot of fresh vegetables and beans. We added spinach and arugula and hot tomatoes, onions, bell pepper. All of that good stuff. cut it all up in thin slices, so it's ready to go. One of the last steps is making the bread really warm, so we put some oil on top of it so it wouldn't get like crusty and dry. And then you just have to assemble the perfect burger. Oh my God, I cannot even tell you how amazing it was and you can see all the tons of layers here. It barely held together. but it was [Music] [Music] [Music] Focus sticks to the top for easier eating, and of course you have to add the french fries and voila. Your perfect burger is complete.

This is a chicken parmesan you eat with your hands, not a fork, so let's get started Now what we have here is garlic, mushrooms, onions and bell pepper. I'm gonna saute our vegetables over medium heat and a little bit of olive oil for about five or six minutes. Once the vegetables are tender and they put down by about half, We're going to transfer these over to a bowl and let them cool for about ten minutes. Once the vegetables have cooled, I've added two pounds of ground chicken. This is light and dark meat, two eggs, black pepper, oregano, basil and Parmesan cheese. Now, I'm gonna get my hands in here and get it all mixed up. Once everything is thoroughly combined, we're gonna form our burgers and now thoroughly coat each burger with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Now into a frying pan with a little bit of vegetable oil. We're gonna cook these over medium heat for about four minutes per side. We're not trying to cook these through. at this point, Just add a nice crust in color. They'll finish up in the oven. Now our burgers go into a 350-degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes until thoroughly cooked and they reach 160 degrees after 8 minutes. I'm gonna top each burger with a slice of provolone cheese, and then back into the oven for another 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese is melted. Now it's time to build our burgers and we're using Kaiser rolls today that I've toasted and a little bit of butter and seasoned with garlic. and now I'm gonna add some jarred spaghetti sauce, the star of the show and another layer of spaghetti sauce. And of course you can use your homemade spaghetti sauce if you like, And there you have it better than advertising a crispy, crunchy, gooey, gooey, juicy, delicious chicken Parmesan burger.

First put all these ingredients into a small saucepan and bring them to a rolling boil. Done, this teriyaki sauce couldn't be easier. set it aside in a large bowl, whisk together some manis, rice, wine, vinegar and sugar, then toss in some cabbage. I like a combination of red and Napa. Then add carrots, red onions, cucumber, and a little bit of cilantro season it to taste with some salt and pepper and mix. I usually use my hands for this once it's mixed. Keep it chilled until we need it. Okay now for the rice buns. soak some rinsed sushi rice for 30 minutes, then cook it to your bag or boxes instructions. And so it's done like this. dump it into a big bowl and start stirring it with a big spatula. You can season it like usual sushi rice. but I'm gonna keep this batch plain using wet fingers and around mold, form dense little patties on a parchment lined sheet pan. pack them down with a lightly oiled spatula, Then you can set them aside aside aside, all right boneless skinless thighs. Get a nice dredging of cornstarch on both sides, then place them on a clean plate, cover the bottom of a wide non-stick pan with oil. Once it hits 350 degrees, you can fire cutlets 5 to 8 minutes, both sides or until juices run clear and they're lightly golden. That was assemble our burger. First toss the cutlet with as much teriyaki sauce as you want. Top, a rice bun with the chicken, a little slaw, another bun and sprinkle on some sesame seeds. Ain't she pretty? look, ma, no bread.

It's me Frankjavcee, And in todays video tutorial. I'm gonna teach you how to make A SYNTHWAVE CHEESEBURGER, So you're going to need the following. You're gonna need some HAMBURGER BUNS, Some onions, Some Ketchup, Some mustard, Some Ground Beef Cheese! and uh salt, and uh Worcestershire sauce, and uh pepper, And don't forget about that egg. First you got to chop up the onions, and then you crack the egg into a thing. Then you put a teaspoon of garlic salt into the egg. Then you put a teaspoon of pepper into the egg. Then you put some WORCESTERSHIRE sauce into the egg, and then afterwards you put some mustard into the egg. Stir it around in a clockwise, to counter clockwise, circle til it gets all mixed up. Then you squeeze the meat ;) into the concoction. Oh, look Hot Cheetos. They're delicious and Nutritious, so I put 12 hot cheetos into a blender and now I'm gonna blend it :SKRILLEX NOISES: HAHAHA, I AM SO FUNNY AND ORIGINAL. Ahahaha, So now that we have the concoction shredded, throw it into the meat. Add some ketchup and onions and mix it with your hands. Make sure you don't have any open wounds on your hands, because the cheetos will burn them. Now, put them into patties and put them on a frying pan with some oil, and cook them about 5 minutes on each side, And then when they cook up and stuff, you flip them so that they can cook on the other side. I like to put some cheese on the cooked side. I'm using white cheese to represent the United States Congress, and then once they're done, you take them out and put them on a plate. And if you like your buns toasted, I know I like my buns toasty. I put these buns in the toaster, and then I just leave them in there :I am happy and content with all my life choices: So now that the buns are done, you take them out and put Thousand island dressing on them. For those of you who don't know what Thousand Island dressing is, Its dressing made out of a thousand of islands. Now you put the patty on top of the Thousand Island toasted bun, and then you cover them, and that is how you make a SYNTHWAVE Flaming HOT CHEETO hamburger! So thank you for watching my videos.

It's a Kindle burger. And because sometimes we, as women tend to have our cravings for burger or something that's also healthy, I decided why not make that healthy option of it? So this one is a completely vegetarian. It's rich in protein and fiber. now which I think the recipes that, I mean, they're usually very quick and easy to me. Now this one is easy to make, but perfect time. for it will take a bit time, but it's totally worth it Now for this recipe you will need two cups of quinoa. What's a? one cup of red kidney beans, one white onion, 2 garlic cloves a 1, a cup of white onion, 2 garlic cloves, a 1, a cup of white onion, 2 garlic cloves a 1, a cup of shredded Parmesan cheese. Add the eggs lightly beaten, so breadcrumb salt pepper, paprika chili powder, olive oil and a half cup of fresh herbs. So let me show you how it's actually First thing first Will mix all the dry ingredients and what I did. I actually blended my red kidney beans. Just so it gets that pasty texture texture texture. Then I added the onions, which I blended as well of or more thinner and smaller texture. and then I added to the X, But actually you can go with 2x because it gets a little liquidy and my burger was a little bit hard to flip it because it was so soft, but I lightly beat two eggs for this recipe, and without should be more than enough for garlic. You can actually cut it into thin pieces and just chop it with the knife, or you can mix it just the way I did it with the mix. it just the way I did it with the mix it just the way I did it with the garlic mincer. Now you can go ahead and I just saw Papa black pepper red chili powder. According to once it's all done, you can go ahead and grill some red peppers or whatever pepper you wish in the pan, or you can go pepper you wish in the pan, or you can go pepper you wish in the pan, or you can go ahead and bake it now. When it comes to making this burger, you can actually bake it and you can go ahead and fry it on it, and you can go ahead and fry it on it, and you can go ahead and fry it on the pan. It's really up to you. whatever you prefer. Now If you want to make it really quick, then go ahead and fry. But just so you know, it doesn't take more than five to six minutes to fully cook it. because the ingredients are already actually cooking. If you wish for more flavor, you can go ahead and add a slice of cheese on top of the burger while the other side is frying and it will melt. It all is just super delicious. Then afterwards you can top it up with some Chile's on you, red pepper, and you can serve it on a burger bun or on a rye. Can serve it on a burger bun or on a rye can serve it on a burger bun or on a rye bread. Like I did, I actually love it with the cracker, so I have a ripe cracker and I just top it on top of that And it's I just top it on top of that And it's I just top it on top of that and it's very delicious and crunchy so I really hope you enjoyed it.

Today, we're going to talk about how to make burgers juicy and delicious. The first thing you want to start with is a great ground beef today. we're going to be working with an 80/20 blend ground Chuck bullpen brand that you can buy online. You want to take note here that if you want to look into other flavors, they're out there. We agar sell a number of different types, whether it be a ground briskets, ground, chuck Angus beef in all sorts of sizes, so whatever you're looking for, we take our can supply it to you. Now that we've picked our burger, we need to create a hamburger patty. pull off about approximately 7 ounces of meat and form it into a nice uniformly shaped burger. I like to have them about three quarters of an inch thick. This keeps that burger nice and juicy without overcooking it while you're making your patty pre-heat your grill to about 375 degrees. If we're doing this outdoors, you want to work with a charcoal grill and keep the temp moderate to high heat. You don't want it too hot, because that will char the outside of the burger and really dry it out, and kill the flavor. once you've got your burger formed, take it over to your grill. place it on the grill and season it. I like using an equal proportion of salt, black pepper and granulated garlic. Cooking time for these burgers is approximately eight to nine minutes. I like to usually cook it on one side for approximately four to five minutes. five minutes, five minutes. That allows the burger to get a nice crisp exterior, and it doesn't dry out the inside. Once you flip it over, Let it go for another four to five minutes. and this should give you a perfect medium burger. Next thing we need to consider for that juicy burger is how we're going to present it. I like using a grilled brioche roll butter. It, put it on your grill and get it that nice, toasty buttery flavor, buttery flavor, buttery flavor. The last thing we want to consider is how we're going to top it. What kind of condiments have we ever thought about? maybe using blue cheese or maybe a cheddar cheese spread? There's a lot of wonderful condiments out there as well, perhaps a creole mayonnaise, or maybe a steak sauce. The sky's the limit on how we can season in flavor our burger. And it's really up to you. Let it fly when we. It's really up to you, let it fly when we. It's really up to you. Let it fly When we come up to creating our perfect burger.

The spicy jalapeno Baja. I love this burger. It's super delicious. Really easy to make and all your friends and family will love it. So for this recipe you will need 1 pound of lead Angus beef. I like mine a little chunky, some leaf lettuce, four slices of jalapeno jack cheese for ciabatta rolls, some ground black pepper, some kosher salt, melted unsalted butter, Chipotle adobo sauce, sliced jalapenos, 8 ounces of whack Amole, 1 thinly sliced tomato and one thinly sliced red onion. Is we all know that burgers are really summer party staples, especially on the fourth of July. It's because grilling is such a casual, relaxed kind of cooking that allows you to actually enjoy your family and friends while you're doing. then. I've already made my patties and buttered my rolls. Now I'm going to get my griddle nice and hot and paint two spaces, because I'm cooking my burgers two by two each about the size of a cooked hamburger patty with melted butter, and then put the patties on the butter, using a heavy spatula to lightly press on each one for about 10 seconds. heads up, guys. You don't want to smash your patties too flat. A little air actually leaves room for the meats juices, which gives us that nice sear that we all love. Add a little salt and pepper to each patty and then let them cook on this side for about two minutes. After two minutes, flip them over and add the cheese so that it melts and then let this side cook for about another one to two minutes. plate your patties and then use your griddle to toast your rolls. When your rolls are nice and warm, pop them on your plate. add your patties and load up your burger with all your fresh ingredients. Add a generous dollop of Chipotle adobo to top them off and watch your friends and family go loco for this burger.

Here's what I got to start these beautiful potato rolls right here. You want to make sure you get yourself a nice roll? I'm going to start with these rolls rolls rolls. Next, I went to the deli and got some boar's head American cheese. If you're gonna go good, Why not go the best? of course here. I got some ground round round round. Let's get started all right. So what I've done here is lay down a double layer of aluminum foil. If you have the really thick stuff, thick stuff, thick stuff, then just you can use one. but unfortunately I don't right now, so the next step is take your ground beef. Now you're making the sliders, So what you want to do is you want to take your ground beef, kind of lift it up a little bit and smooth it out, but you want to make sure it doesn't really stick. You're just kind of smoothing it out to the point to where you're going to cut it into little square patties Once you've got it all flattened out and you can use a rolling pin. Just use it lightly lightly lightly, and I would recommend using wax paper instead of foil, but I don't have that. Not a problem. You can still use it. It will come off. but wax taper is better because it slides off easier. What you're doing now is that you've made it flat enough is you're making those actual those actual, those actual, beautifully thin slider patties. Uh, you don't want them too thick. Otherwise you're just eating a small thick burger. If you like it that way, go with it, but this is for sliders, so here we go, take a knife and just start taking the edges like that. Now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties, So don't think that you're wasting any meat as you go along gently, use your knife. Start cutting the edges, edges edges, and moving it aside. All right, I'm going to finish this and I'll get back to you in a moment. and here's a basic idea of what it looks like like Like just simple square patties. You can salt them. Now. I prefer to salt them after they come off just because it's all usually falls. So now you want to just toast those buns. Put them under your broiler for like 30 seconds to a minute, depending on how high you have the rack, and how and how and how strong your broiler is, but look beautiful. All right, So we got the burgers ready. Let's put them on the uh pan here. I think, use the pan to around four and a half to five for a few minutes, and they're a little slider burger here. Very nice. See in a moment all right, So I got one side done moving it around it around it around. beautiful slider In here now are nicely cut cheese, kind of cut it a little bigger than those patties there. yummy, yummy, There you go. there's your sliders, sliders, sliders, Let's finish them off really quick with the bun, you.", "segments": {"6": [160, 25, 168, 2], "5": [160, 0, 158, 18], "4": [134, 10, 144, 17], "3": [114, 32, 114, 30], "2": [100, 22, 100, 20], "1": [48, 0, 46, 27]}}

Okay, crack in one egg. No, it's just a puzzle together. You don't need using you this rubbish, breadcrumbs and flour. Anything, Do using it again? Okay, so after giving it a good mix around, we're just gonna use our scale and pushing them into 200 gram balls. then we'll flatten or make them into patties. Did you just do in one hand? Just move quickly coming into patties anyway, So basically grab the balls they've just made, Get a bowl of hot warm water massage that into a nice perfect circle of all the more round it is, and the more of all the more round it is, and the more of all the more round it is, and the more flat and perfect patty. it's gonna turn out, so take your time.

Believe it or not, In a few minutes, these are gonna be delicious, delicious, delicious. The perforation on these burgers is for two reasons, one to tenderize and two to help it release from the grill. We're just going to start by seasoning generously with salt and pepper, and then place seasoned side down on a hot grill, then peel off the wax paper. Now season the other side generously with salt and pepper again. Once these burgers have been on the grill for three or four minutes, we'll give them a 45 degree turn to give those nice restaurant style grill marks another two or three minutes, and we'll give them a flip. once they've cooked for two or three minutes. On this side, we'll give them one more turn and add the cheese. We're looking for a nice medium here. The way that I like to spice this burger up is by adding a little Japanese hot sauce to some regular store-bought mayonnaise. Generously layer this onto both sides of your bun, then place your burger down, and a little classic lettuce and tomato never hurts. Lots of people think that a burger is a burger, but it's all in how you dress it up that makes the big difference.

And let me tell you once you go, Lucy, you never go back. We're gonna mix our ground beef with horses, your sauce, and then separate the meat into four equal portions, and carefully make our patties. Now you want them about a quarter-inch thick and about five inches in diameter, then we're going to take our American cheese. fold it into quarters to make a short stack. We're going to put two slices of cheese onto each burger and then take the second patty and top the burger, being sure to seal the edges Really Well, I love cheese, so that's why I'm using two slices in each burger, but sometimes I get a little wild and add three slices. It's really up to you, but my recommendation keep it classic by using American cheese. All right, And now I'm just going to season with a little salt, garlic, powder and pepper, and then heat up my skillet to a medium-high heat. add a little vegetable oil and then cook for three to four minutes now while the burger is cooking, not only is the cheese melting, but also keeps the meat juicy and tender, and another great tip is, don't press the patty down with your spatula, or else you're gonna push up the cheese out. Okay once it's brown, flip it over and then cover the skillet with a lid and cook for another three to four minutes.

We're making this smushed splat, Smash burger all crispy and Lacy and and basically the best burger you ever had. Well, the thing is, Smash burgers have become very in vogue lately, but we've all loved forever, whether you've gone to in and out or Shake Shack or that diner you grew up, going to. the key to actually making the patty is that the the meat itself is as loosely packed as possible, because the more you packet, the denser becomes and the texture becomes kind of hard. You want to just pick it up your hand and smash it right in the pan. That's it, and step away from the pan. The thing is, people always talk about all I love a grilled burger or grilled burgers are not easy to make because all the good stuff in the burger, the fat and juice drips into the fire so often times you're left with a burger that's kind of smoky and self and crispy, but it doesn't have the good stuff. The most important thing what the meat is, It has to be at thing, what the meat is, it has to be at thing. what the meat is. It has to be at least 20% fat. Fat is where the flavor is, And if you get like the lean ground beef, it's just not going to work. Fat is flavor. If you don't have fat, you're not going to get a flavorful burger. The bun is one. A, the worst thing is no, the bun is one. A. the worst thing is no, the bun is one A. The worst thing is no one wants, like the brioche or the pretzel roll, or these like sort of highfalutin nonsense we love at Bon Appetit, A good potato roll, often from Martins. If you can find them. What's nice about them is they're soft. They're moist or a little squishy, and you'll notice they're not too big. The bun should never overwhelm the burger. The burger is the star, the bun is the compliment. The most important thing to remember is a burger is not meatloaf. It doesn't need like special fixings and ingredients you don't need to put onions in, and all sorts of other stuff. A great burger is beef and salt, maybe pepper like that's it. No more. If you want to put a bunch of toppings on, That's up to you, but a burger itself is the burger itself. If you want to do a special sauce, that's great, some version of ketchup and mayonnaise, and then, if you want to put a little Dijon in there, a little garlic powder or some relish of chopped pickles, that's kind of up to you some hot sauce. But there's got to be Mayo. You have to have Mayo on a good smash burger. There has to be cheese. Yes, I'm afraid there does, and it has to be American cheese like Yes or a million great cheese is out there, but none of them melt like American cheese. American cheese sort of cloaks the burger. It gets all glossy and gooey and no other cheese can do that. So you got to go America. So many restaurants make a burger so complicated because I guess they want to charge a lot of money for it, but no one charge a lot of money for it, but no one charge a lot of money for it, but no one actually wants it. Everyone wants the simple burger. It ain't hard. Wow, that is ridiculously good and crispy and so crazy juicy. Mmm, let me come home. You should need a napkin when you get burger like this.", "segments": {"6": [102, 0, 118, 5], "5": [80, 31, 94, 26], "4": [78, 21, 78, 19], "3": [54, 28, 54, 26], "2": [50, 6, 50, 21], "1": [30, 0, 28, 33]}}

You start with a ground beef that's at least 80% lean and 20% fat. Buy from a really good butcher or somebody you trust.
